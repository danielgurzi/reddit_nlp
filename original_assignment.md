# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

### Description

In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project will put those skills to the test.

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:
1\. Using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
2\. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.

#### About the API

Pushshift's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is use the following url: <https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?subreddit=boardgames>

To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use the API: <https://youtu.be/AcrjEWsMi_E>

### Requirements

-   Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.
-   **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a Bayes classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.
-   A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.
-   An executive summary of your results.
-   A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.

**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).

* * *

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

-   Code and executive summary must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.
-   You must submit your slide deck.
-   Materials must be submitted  **on Friday, May 29th**. Presentation is due at **10:00AM EST**, the rest of the materials are due **by EOD, Friday, May 29th**.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0** | _Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item._                                                                 |
| **1** | _Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations._          |
| **2** | _Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations._                      |
| **3** | _Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration._ |

### Why did we choose this project for you?

This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.

Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).

Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.

Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.
