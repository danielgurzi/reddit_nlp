personalfinance,"I’m a 28 year old male. I’m a new homeowner (it’s been about a year and a half) and I have about $23,000 of credit card debt. In addition to that, I have about $30,000 in student loan debt that I currently have in forbearance. I believe that the forbearance expires in September and I would like to continue to forgo paying them for a long as I possibly can. 

I make around $52,000 a year.

I have $22,500 currently in my 401k and already have a loan against that I took out when we bought the house that has a balance around $6,000 and about 3.5 years left. 

There are options to do another loan of up to $16,000 and an option to just do a withdrawal and I’m able to take out the full amount of what I have in my 401k ($22,500). 

My reason for wanting to do this is to pay my credit cards off and have a fresh slate. And of course, start spending wisely so that I don’t end up in this situation ever again. 

At first I was thinking about doing another loan, but the thought of having to pay $200/paycheck sounds terrible. This seems like a really good opportunity to get a lump sum and just pay them all off completely. 

Obviously there are downsides to doing this. I’d be starting my retirement savings all over again. But I don’t see any other option at this point of ever getting out of debt.",Should I take advantage of the no penalty option to make a withdrawal from my 401k?

I am 21 years old and a contractor for the government. I have minimal expenses (insurance, phone/internet, and food)

I recently started playing around with the stock market on robinhood, which in my opinion is pretty straight forward.

However I was told to open a retirement account. I chose a roth IRA, because from what I understand it’s profits are not taxable when I go to withdraw my money at 60 or whatever.

I have contributed $2k to the account however I’m not getting how to use the account. It seems that I invest the same as in robinhood, choose the symbol to invest in? Or do I invest in a a clump symbol like S&amp;P 500 etc? Is there a way to make the account automatically invest the money I contribute? The app is kinda confusing, and turns me away as compared to robinhood. If I do invest in Apple for example, what’s the difference between robinhood and the IRA account? As far as I can see there is no difference so that’s what confuses me.

Now onto my investment question. I have managed to save up about $35k, no debt. $5k is in my robinhood (84% ETFs, 16% Stocks) and $2k is in my fidelity account (100% Stocks). I don’t want the rest to just sit in my savings account when I could use it to make money. So the question is, should I continue doing what I’m doing?

personalfinance,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this type of question.

To give some context, I just finished my freshman year at an engineering school, where I am studying computer engineering. My parents are quite well off and helping me pay for the pricy out of state tuition and expenses (I didn't get any good in-state offers), but not all of it. We made the decision for me to attend the out of state university together, and laid out a solid financial plan, where the total cost would be split 30% from my father, 30% my mother, and 40% in student loans, with maximum federal loans and the rest private loans cosigned by my father.

I recognize this is a huge responsibility and spent many months agonizing over the decision before deciding to attend, but ultimately decided it was the best thing to do for my future goals.

Anyways, we all agreed that this would be doable as my mother and father both work, have a decent amount of savings, and are not financially burdened in any other way besides me and my brother's university expenses (though he is almost done). 

Fast forward one year, and I realized my mother did not pay anything towards the tuition and allowed my father to pay 60%. She works and makes a decent amount of money, but she basically makes my dad pay for most of their expenses, and she doesn't touch anything else. She really wanted me to go with this university and basically convinced my dad that it was the best thing to do, but now does not want to pay a dime. When I confronted her about this and told her it was unfair to my dad, she claims he has a much larger retirement account than her and feels he should be able to pay for my university alone (He is a bit older than her, so nearing retirement). She is not very financially literate, but she does make a lot of money. 

This is putting my father in a tough situation, where he is paying for my university, my brother's university, most of their other expenses, such as a mortgage that is almost paid, utilities, most of the car debt, and trying to max his 401k contributions, as well as cosigning for my private loans. I hate the fact that my dad is in this situation, but I don't know what else I can do. Should I try to convince my mother to pitch in what she can? Both of them are otherwise content and do not mind me going to this university, and so I would really rather not drop out or go somewhere else, especially considering my graduation would likely be delayed another year. I also do not want to go into any more debt than planned just to make things easier for my father. I would appreciate any advice you guys can give me. Thanks!",Student Loans and Parents

Hi All,

I (22M) started my first full-time job in February and am looking for some guidance for how I should prioritize some financial goals.

My salary is $74,000, with my monthly take-home being around $4,300. Standard monthly expenses (Rent, utilities, insurance, food, etc.) total about $1,800, leaving about $2,500 net per month.

I am currently contributing 10% of my earnings to my 401k (employer matches 3%), which means I have around $1,900-$2,000 to play around with each month.

I currently have around $22,000 in student loan debt that I have not yet begun to pay off, as the grace period doesn’t end until September. I have no credit card debt. My emergency fund is about $6,000. I will need to buy a new (to me) car soon, as I currently drive a beater with 200,000 miles on it. I also hope to save for some larger future expenses like an eventual down payment on a house, wedding, etc.

So, my question is how should I prioritize these financial goals? Should I pour every dollar into paying off my student loans as fast as possible? Should I add even more to my 401k and pay the student loans and car payments over time? Should I chip away at the student loan and pay for a new car in cash as soon as possible? Should I forget everything else for a few months and bolster my emergency fund?

Rent and bills around maybe $2500 a month. 

I won’t let her pay into my debt because it wasn’t her fault, and that was my past. 

I don’t use these cards at all anymore other than one card I owe nothing on and just use/pay immediately to get the points on it. (Is that bad too?)

My credit score is at 715 somehow. Never actually missed a payment of had anything wrong other than a high balance. I would assume if I can get to zero my score would be really good in that case?

The point - Is it best for me to just keep chipping away at each, while targeting one with larger payments while others get minimums paid, or is my best option to explore a personal loan and just dump what I can every month into it? Or is there a better option?

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me if my appraisal makes sense:

&amp;#x200B;

Inventory is low and demand hasn't gone down much.  So prices are staying high for those who do sell.

&amp;#x200B;

If we assume that demand continues to remain high, what evidence is there that housing prices will come down?

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps due to economic conditions, more people will be forced into selling, driving down prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Also possible is that we introduce (further) legislation to halt foreclosures.  Since banks are locked into their unprofitable investments, they will have less available cash to lend.  But since the Fed is printing more money and lending it to banks, the banks can continue to lend, which (the Fed hopes) will promote economic recovery (at the expense of an enormous addition to our national debt.)

\- I make 96k/yr in a medium COL area.

\- I contribute 12% of my salary to my 401k, plus an employer match of 5%. So I'm contributing a hell of a lot into that already. I have $22k in it currently, the combined contribution each bi-weekly paycheck is $633, and I'm 31 years old, so I feel like I'm in good shape here.

\- I bought a house last year. $200k, new construction, put 20% down so no PMI. Making all my payments on time, plus extra principle payments each month. \~$160k in mortgage debt from this. 3.875% interest rate.

\- Only other debt is my car payment. It's $365/month, the interest rate is 3.5%. I have about $12k left, I'm not in any huge rush to dump money into paying it off given how low the interest rate is.

\- I have an Ally bank savings account. It used to have a much higher interest rate, but that rate has fallen (obviously) to 1.25%. Still higher than a lot of other places, but it's less than half of what it was a year ago. I have $52k in my savings.

Like I said, I'm in good shape. With my Ally account being at a lower interest rate, I'm wondering what options I have to grow my money. Ally offers CDs but only at 1.3%, which isn't worth it at all IMO.

I could move my checking account from Chase to Ally and get the 0.1% interest on that. I keep a few thousand in my checking account for bill pay and whatnot, so getting anything at all on that would be cool. But again, that's nothing.

So, do I have any obvious options to strengthen my financial position even more? I'm already putting a lot of money in for retirement, but are there any other decent investing/saving strategies beyond that?",Looking for saving/investing advice

personalfinance,"Hi everyone. I hope this can be a judgment free zone and looking to get some good financial/personal advice from folks on this subreddit who are money savvy and thinking about next year's economy. Here are the key points:

1. My entire family operates two small business restaurants in California. We have a $200K small business loan at 6% interest. 
2. We have one single family home with about $130K remaining on our mortgage.
3. We have $200K in savings. We are not spending it to pay down the loan or mortgage because we are thinking about buying a house or starting another business. 

Here's the problem: My parents are near retirement age and want to stop working soon because they are physically shot at this point. We've been investing in 401Ks for them and have put in a good $70K over the past few years for them so that it can help with their retirement down the line. I want them to make the best investment possible so that they can actually retire and live the rest of their lives with as little worry as possible. 

Our family has been talking about how the economy is headed for a recession given the pandemic so I've advised them to buy a home rather than start a new restaurant which has tons of risks involved but may reap greater short term profits. This sounds terrible, but, if the economy tanks and mortgage delinquencies rise (which is already happening at record levels as of April 2020), we think buying a home is the best option so that we can rent out one house and use that rent to cover the new home's mortgage. Our businesses are still somewhat profitable (not as profitable as pre-COVID, but still doing okay).

Our plan is:

1. Continue operating businesses as is and save as much as possible in order to...
2. Pay down the small business loan as much as possible because the interest alone is costing us $1K per month and we also believe we can cut down the home mortgage loan by half by Q1 of 2020.
3. Buy a home next year as home prices fall and more mortgage delinquencies rise, move to that home, and rent out our current home

I'm notoriously paralyzed by decision making and now that we're in the final stage, one where we're offered a chance to abort mission, I'm feeling very uneasy about making such a big decision. I don't have any family who own their homes so I haven't had anyone to bounce questions off of. I've felt very confident that the refinance was the correct decision but I'd love to hear thoughts from some folks outside of my own head. Details are below:

**The original loan:**

$328,500 original loan value, originated in May of 2018. Appraised at $365,000 We've made 24 (2 years) of payments. 5% rate. $300/mo in PMI. Total monthly payment = $2399.00

**The new loan:**

$327,200 new loan value, appraised at $400,000. 3.65% rate. $57/mo in PMI. Total Payment = $1880.00

We're saving just over $500 monthly. Our closing costs amounted to just over $7k which included a 2% origination fee. We know this fee wasn't particularly great, but navigating a refi during COVID times was not a fun task and we're accepting that for what it is.

With the savings, I'm seeing we'll hit a break even point at 14 months. We plan on staying in this house for at least another 3-4 years, so this seems to make sense. Saving $500 monthly after that will mean that we can be very comfortable with saving monthly.

I feel like I've partially answered my own question, but I just need some validation and or advice if this wasn't a ""good deal"". Is this refi a good choice considering the circumstances? Should we hit abort and try again once rates drop further? Should I just plan to refi in another year or so if rates *do* drop even further, but take what I can get for now?

Thanks for reading and for bearing with me. I wish I were a more confident person when it comes to decision making.",Mortgage Refinance - Did we make the right choice?
personalfinance,"I (21M) am a recent grad set to be making $60k in the southern US soon. The position I am taking is located in a coastal area, and because of this it seems like the availability of rentals is pretty strained. I'm just hypothesizing, but most of the decent rental properties seem to serve as vacation rentals rather than long-term housing. There is one semi-decent seeming newer complex that could be a good last resort for me, but I think they're able to charge a massive premium since it's the only updated complex in the area ($1,164/mo for a 1BR, and we all know this would increase massively after the first year). I think I would be willing to spend that much if the complex were located in an area where you could walk to activities (beach/shopping), but it's really nothing special.

There are, however, a decent number of condos for sale around at what I think are reasonable prices. One that I am looking at is a new construction 2BR listed at $177k, and I estimate I could have monthly costs of around $975 (insurance/tax/HOA included). I am lucky to have around $75k saved from windfalls, so it wouldn't be difficult to put 20% down, pay closing costs, and still have a good emergency fund leftover. My FICO is 744. I have no other debts, but I also will be in the market for a new [to me] car ASAP. I wouldn't be interested in renting out a second room.

The issue is that I have no idea how long I'd like to stay in the area. I think my job security would be good (it's with the federal government), but there is just no way to see into the future and see how much I will even like this job a year down the line. There would also be a small dating pool there, which isn't trivial to me. How unreasonable would it be to hire a property management company if I do decide to move elsewhere? I think the rental value of the particular condo I'm looking at would be at least $1,150.

Please feel free to tell me I am insane! I definitely think I would prefer to rent to start with, but I also don't want to be throwing money away on an overpriced apartment I don't even like when I have the opportunity to buy something I love.",Am I insane for even considering buying?

I have all my other bases covered: life insurance, college fund, retirement fund, etc. I have no other debt.

I want to replicate something I did during the 2015 ""mini down turn"" which allowed me to buy the farm: cash out/refinance using my home's equity, buy a couple of properties in a low risk area, wait two or three years and cash out for a decent profit, pay back a good chunk of the refinanced loan and invest the balance in a vacation home. However, I'm concerned I might be overpaying on the quoted refinanced loans: 3.125% 15yrs on a 450K loan is marginally better than my current interest rate.

I don't have a specific property in mind, but I'm happy to take the risk a new opportunity will arise, at which time I will be a ""cash buyer"". What am I missing?

personalfinance,"Hey y'all - looking for some suggestions on my (M 26) budget. 

My biggest question is if it makes sense to pay down a car loan ahead of schedule to avoid interest, or put more of that money into a Roth IRA/other savings. Job's pretty stable, but my savings aren't built up very high so trying to be as smart as I can be. 

Monthly Take-home is: $3054.   
Monthly spend on rent, utilities, health insurance, food, &amp; a few treats for myself (gym, hulu) equal $1800 (HCOL area). Can break this out if helpful but I don't think I'm doing anything too crazy - I know I should reduce this overall my partner will be increasing their contribution to shared costs soon when they finish school. 

I try to give away $100/mo to charities and friends that need help, I'd like to keep that up as well - so all told that leaves \~ $1000 for saving/paying for this car with a $100 buffer. 

Current Savings:  
Emergency Fund: $2500  
Roth IRA: $6300   
Regular IRA: $3000 (Set this up before I knew what a Roth was - not contributing to at present)

Current Car Loan:  
$11,100 over 46 mo. Payment is \~$242/mo on that schedule, and I'd wind up paying 4.9% interest all in. 

When I got the loan the idea was to pay it back quickly to save on interest, so for the past few months I've done:  
\+$150 Emergency Fund  
\+$400 Roth IRA  
\+450 Car Loan

personalfinance,"So a little backstory, I’m only 17 but hoping to move out by Fall. I have a car, no debts, and hoping to have 2k put into a high yield savings account from my graduation party. 
The rent is 625 a month including all utilities except electric. Anyway I’m currently working at a restaurant as a busser but it’s been rough lately. The way it works is you get paid $5 an hour and then 1.25% of what they made during your shift is given to you at the end of the night as tips. Which seems to range between $30-$60 dollars. With the high end of that tending to be on Sunday’s when they’re busy. The point of this is to help you figure out what I’m making now. It’s not horrible I guess but they only let me work 5 hour shifts since I’m under 18 and they’d have to give me a break otherwise. I’m only at 20 hours a week and right now that’s fallen to like 8-10 hours. And with reduced capacity tips are about $8-12 a night. So pay is real rough since I’m trying to save this summer before moving out and I obviously can’t live on that. Now onto the new job opportunity. I got a letter today from a Marketing Company called Vector asking me to apply. Offering 15 an hour and full or part time. I’d probably start with 30 hours and move to 40 a month or so before I move out. Anyway to get to the main question, I’ve only worked at the restaurant about 3 months. I’m guessing it would reflect badly on me to put in my 2 weeks? And should I wait until a better job opportunity and not do the marketing thing? 

Just some extra info: I was told in a text message from the company that basically I’d be talking with costumers, answering questions, and helping place orders.

personalfinance,"With interest rates so low, and lots of the world even moving towards negative rates, money market rates, and CDs, are returning little over 1%.

The federal reserve has stated that they want to maintain 2% inflation. This means you're really losing money by earning less than 2% (although it's still better than losing the full 2% by doing nothing).

However...there are bonds, offered by the federal reserve, to negate inflation. These are called TIPS (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp), and there are even index funds to track them, like [VTAPX](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=vtapx%20stock%20price).

Since the federal reserve has stated the inflation target is 2%, it should come as no surprise that the yearly return on this fund is almost 2%. Considering they're backed by the US government, these seem like a no-brainer, unless there's a good reason to believe CDs/money markets will return 2%+ in the near future. These index funds would also have the benefit of having much more liquidity than a CD.

I signed it off and looking at paperwork now I think a lot of the costs are either unnecessary or can be eliminated. I had the ability to pay off in full, but I didnt want to withdraw money from my ROTH IRA. The finance guy told me after the fact that the reason they added the extended warranty is because if I hadn't then my interest rate would have been 18 vs 11 rn. He also told me if I had told him that I didn't want an extended warranty that he could have left the 18 percent interest rate and that credit score/first time buyer I likely wouldn't have been able to buy the vehicle. That extended warranty cost me almost 3k. Then they added the GAP which is necessary, but if i pay enough for more than half the car's cost to be covered would that eliminate the necessity for it?

Over the last two years I've paid off my credit cards as well as dealt with being sued over a personal loan debt in collections, then successfully filed the paperwork (by myself) necessary to have the case dismissed and also negotiating that debt down to 50% of the balance.

Now, I've been faced with my final bit of debt that has surfaced in collections. This is the last account in bad standing, and I'm excited to put this one behind me. 

The debt is &lt;$2,000 from a Capital One credit card I opened while living in another state. The last payment I ever made on it was July 2017 after moving to California. In August 2019 this popped up onto my credit report as collections. I knew what the debt was, but prior to it showing up on my report, I had never received correspondence from Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC regarding this. 

Three months ago I decided to dispute this on my credit report. I received a notification that it was unsuccessfully disputed, and 3-4 weeks later I received mail from Portfolio Recovery Associates with the charge-off letter from Capital One (which was addressed to my previous residence in another state, hence why I had no knowledge of it). The letter also included the final account statement. 
A few weeks after that I received a letter from PRA's attorney's giving me 30 days to respond. 

So, now I'd like to know my best course of action. 

Do I respond to the attorneys or PRA? Do I do so via phone or in writing? I'd really like to negotiate a pay-for-delete and set this all behind me so I can fully focus on my car and student loan debts.

I'm not bad with rules, especially since money often operates in flows (input vs output). Are there general lifestyle principles that allow a person to bring themselves, sustainably, out of debt, and have some to spare? If so, what are they (either according to a qualified expert, or according to you, or whatever.) I guess I'm just seeking good advice but am unsure if I'd know all of them.

1. Don't overspend or put yourself in debt
2. Don't live above your means
3. Spend when necessary, don't spend if unnecessary

and so on

But these all point to the same goal, which is flow of input being greater than output, minimizing output, and maximizing input. Some of these are psychologically inflected, like maybe if you work too hard you've got to party it all out, and spend some money, and operate with those flows still in mind. Maybe even that is a shallow representation of what it takes to save up money and not spend it all of the time.

House would cost 250K-300K so a mortgage around 1700? Renting is likely to go up for me to 1800/mo, costing 21K a year in rent.

About a year ago, I delicately and with much thought, entered into what I call the Balance Transfer Shuffle (see old reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/d30bra/the_0_balance_transfer_shuffle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)).

Fast forward and turns out I'm sh\*t at paying off my debt (*actually, I'm quite good at paying off my debt. I'm actually terrible at earning income with which to do the paying*). 

I started out with about **$24K** in debt with an average APR (dollar weighted) of **15.64%**. I'm now sitting with **$23,500** in debt with an average interest rate of **2.61%**.

I may be even worse at formulating an endgame strategy before the end arrives and the end is near. The strategy was to have pay down at least one of the $9K 0% balances, let credit rebound, then apply for a loan to consolidate the rest. Then COVID happened, work ceased, and the plan was mangled. 

On the upside 

* I accrued much less interest in the past year than I would have otherwise.

On the downside

* I'm *still* in the same amount of debt
* **Credit score** dropped *(760 -&gt;* ***670****)*
* Fewer/complicated options to earn *more* money due to COVID-19 
   * *(Currently receiving UI benefits that will keep me afloat-but not flush--I'm a hybrid worker and am receiving under-calculated benefits-- until the CARES Act runs its course at the end of July)*. 

Those 0% promotions will begin to expire in the coming months (**8/2020** *($9,200)***, 9/2020** *($9,700)***, 1/2021** *($800)*). I'm weighing my options and requesting support / advice.

I *do not* want to continue the 0% shuffle. No more new cards. *The 1/2021 card still has an active 0% balance transfer promo available until 1/21, but with a small credit limit.* 

I have been saving all of my UI benefits and have $6K in the bank. 

I'm not sure how likely it is that I'll be able to qualify for a loan to handle the $18K+ that will begin to incur. I'm still leaning toward this option with the thought that a lower APR is a lower APR even if it's for a reduced amount. However, I'm concerned about the effect this will have on my credit score. 

As for lifestyle changes and choices, there's not much else I can do to spend less. My girlfriend and I live together, are staying home, and not spending money. We're even considering downsizing to a one car household even though we live in LA. 

Thanks for making it to the end. I realize that this is merely a plea for help or maybe I just needed to get it off my chest, but I am hopeful that someone has some ideas that I may not have thought about.

personalfinance,"Come next month, I will have the money in the bank to pay off all my debt. Which thankfully isn't all that much now, about $4300 (my car loan is another $5600).

Now one of my debts is $1800, which is interest-free until September, which I plan to pay off in full regardless. For the rest of my debt, however, I'm debating sticking with the minimum monthly payments (which are *mostly* interest, and come out to $95/month).

Here's my thinking;

That little bit of extra cash gives me a *bit* of wiggle-room, in case ""life"" happens. A coworker of mine said during the last recession, a lot of credit card companies were cutting peoples' available credit, and given a recession seems increasingly likely, I feel like I could easily find myself in a position with no debt but also no money.

Now, on the positive side of things, I've managed to cut my spending down quite a lot. I currently bring home $4,078 a month, and I've got my spending to about $2500 a month, which is a cool $1500 a month saved. So it wouldn't take terribly long to accrue enough money to pay it off and *still* have money in the bank.

I guess my thinking is, though, that I'm effectively paying $95/month in order in exchange for *not* paying $3200 off. Things are a little uncertain with my job (I'm personally kicking ass, but I'm in one of the less-profitable departments at my company and we're transitioning into an ESOP; this pandemic could not have come at a worse time), and I guess I just like to plan for the worst.

Or should I just plan on ripping off the band-aid as soon as I can?","Next month, I will have the money to pay off all debt (besides my car loan). Am I right in holding off?"

Budget: After maxing out 401k matched contributions, estimating take-home pay after taxes, and accounting for healthcare costs through work plans, monthly income will be around $4,800. I think rent will be around $1,800 (it is a very high cost of living area) and Utilities (phone-$35, electric-$75, internet-$70) will be $180. I have \~$24,000 in college loans which I plan on tackling with $800 every month. I think car insurance will be around $344 (this is the biggest guess of my whole budget because I am currently on my mother's car insurance but that will not be the case for much longer). Subscriptions will total $32 a month. Finally, food will probably be around $450 ($250 for groceries, $100 for eating out dinner, $100 for eating out lunch, sidenote: work provides lunch most days). That would leave around $1,000 I can put in savings for emergencies and other expensive purchases and the rest as flex money/debt money. If I had roommates I think I could lower rent by about $1,000 but I am not sure it makes sense for me right now. Work will be really close to my planned apartment so gas shouldn't cost much.

1) We have two larger dogs, which is going to put a damper on a housing search for both of us.

2) Neither of us can afford to carry a two mortgages or rent (Northeast US, where housing prices are insane.)

3) Even if we do sell immediately (alternate housing not withstanding) I'm not even sure we'd break even - I thinks it's very likely that we'd wind up owing additional money to the lender just to get out of the mortgage.

I don't really want to do this, but I'm thinking that my only option would be to:

1) Get an appraisal and figure out what we would be likely to get after all is said and done

1a) Somehow (with legal assistance) figure out how to equitably split any proceeds up to that point (if any) when the house eventually does sell

2) Refinance in my name only (stretching out the mortgage to 30 years again, but reducing it by about $300 a month)

Or - is this money best invested.  So that 200 a month for 10 years produces more value - invested at 6-7% annually?  Or that $3,000 from my two skipped mortgage payments - invest it and hope for 6-7% annually - opposed to making principal only payments.

With all my loans, plus two kids in daycare, I'm only putting a little bit away each month, so I'm trying to decide between saving cash now, or being free from a lot of debt sooner. 

I have a mortgage, a personal loan (used to renovate the house) and a car loan. 

I am refinancing the mortgage at a far better rate (I'm a recent immigrant so my credit wasn't great when I bought) and increasing equity quite a lot, thanks to the renovations I did. 

So that leaves me with a sizable personal loan and a car loan. 

The car loan will be paid off in 12 months, but the payment is high - so I'm wondering whether I should refinance for a better rate, or just pay it down. 

The personal loan is big - $65k left - and still has a little over 6 years left. So with that I am thinking about refinancing to a $50k, 24mo loan, and just paying down $15k cash. 

With the mortgage refinance cutting my costs significantly, I could keep paying down the car loan and refi the personal loan while still saving a couple hundred a month. OR I could refi the personal loan for for 48mo, and stretch the car loan out to another 48 months and save a lot more money while doing so. 

I've done some basic math and in the first scenario I'd be free from the car and personal loans in 12 and 24 months respectively, which would lead to $87k savings after 4 years.

personalfinance," 

When you refinance your mortgage, you will already get to physically skip two payments. The month it funds and the month after. It's still getting paid but via the new loan amount aka it doesn't come out of your checking. 

The forbearance program is for 3 months and then all 4 payments are due on the following month! There's really no point unless you're out of work and have no options. 

With the refinance, you'll get a two month break, a refund of your escrow balance, and walk away with a lower payment. Clearly this is the better move.

I am 26. I have about a dozen and a half single payment loans from the U.S. Dept of Education that have all moved to collections in the past 1-2 years that are not being paid. They range from $150 to $10k (average $4k), and total $78k. 

I have no other debt, no credit cards. Credit score is 530. I live at home with my father, do not drive for work, and outside of food have little expenses. I live within my means and my living condition is stable.  

I have a bit over $100k in savings. I make $80k a year before taxes. Most of the money I currently earn and have earned can be used as needed. 

I have read the wiki for [Collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections) and [Debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt), and several other similar threads.

**My goals:**

1. Create a plan and pay off my debt, ideally both economically and quickly
2. Start to build good credit so I can live a normal life

**This is what I've gathered so far** - please correct if I am wrong:

1. I am not near 7 year mark for any of these debts
2. I should start with validating each debt without admission of debt as outlined in the Collections Wiki. 
3. Everything should be in writing; I should not let the CA's know I have full cash on hand, I should not link my bank account, and if I were to make a payment I should so in mailed checks.
4. For verified debts, I can contact CA's and try to negotiate a pay for delete, lump sum, ideally at a lower amount. 
5. CA's do not need to agree to a pay for delete. I believe my goal in this scenario is to work out a debt payment plan to the CA that makes sense to me. I'm not sure what that would be specifically for me.

personalfinance,"So I saw a video on youtube from said creator. In it, he has content talking about why you should NOT save up large amounts of money for retirement.  


His premise is this. If you retire on the lowest end of the scale, and get the smallest possible social security check... your going to get large discounts on things like medicare (if you pay at all) and other programs and things like utility assistance and SNAP benefits, possibly subsidized housing and so on.  


It got the ole gears turning a bit...  


The first ""problem"" that comes to mind is what happens if things change radically in the future and the ""system"" can't or won't support the masses all doing this? What if the government comes around and says ""welp, we gotta cut the handouts in half or better... sorry""... and a lot of the ""free stuff"" goes away and now I have nothing saved.  


The second ""problem"" is sorta related to the first, but how could an economy work when a lot more people start doing this? The only option I see would be to print money until it became pointless to even have or use.  


  
Now I am not seriously considering doing this. At 33 years old I'm heading for six figures saved in my 401k and plan to be debt free totally (including a paid off house) within 10 years. As a house hold that is earning 6K a month now, my 401k web app through my provider suggests an estimated 6500 is what I'll need each month (in todays dollars) and that I'll collect $6100 a month (in todays dollars) from both social security and medicare.  


I am wondering... how much better off will I really be? The money is just as protected from what I understand... other than owing the government money, no one can take the money directly. And just the same as the social security check (I think?) it's fair game once it hits my account as well. It's just that no one can take it ""directly"" until it hits the accounts.  


So... I'll have to pay my medical insurance, I'll have to pay my own food, my own utilities... no help on the housing costs (but I really won't have one... so to speak). I will have to pay taxes on that money.  


So how does it break down? Lets say $600 a month on food for two people? $300-400 for utilities? Insurance costs? Taxes? Even still, swipe me down as much as $2000 a month for all that. I still have $4100 MORE each month than the person living on the system right?

personalfinance,"Throwaway account, just like my retirement apparently.

Backstory - I used to work for XYZ Company and had an employer sponsored retirement account through Paychex.  I had both a traditional Pre-Tax 401(k) and a Roth.  Some time after changing employers, I set out to rollover these accounts into personal accounts - Jan-Mar 2020.  Paychex included a prompt that would keep my interaction with the process at a minimum as I did not want to receive a live paper check to then have to forward elsewhere.  Per the prompts that I no longer have access to, an ACH would be initiated between Paychex and Merrill Edge to rollover my balances.  Wonderful, I thought, the two banks could talk to each other and get me set up.  Prior to initiating that transfer, I made sure to have Merrill Edge accounts ready to receive the Pre-Tax funds and Roth funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I initiated the transfer through Paychex, the system ask for no additional information and I was never prompted to input any account numbers.  Some days later I received a message stating ""This email confirms that Paychex Retirement Services sent a direct deposit in response to your recent distribution request in the amount of $70,000.00, distribution ID 1234567. Your ACH was sent today to the account number that you provided.""

I immediately responded with: ""This email gives very little information. What account number was the rollover sent to and who is the managing company? Also, this looks to be about $55,000.00 short of what should be rolling over out of my XYZ Company Paychex account. I had both a Traditional AND Roth 401(k). Please advise.""

When the transfer finally showed up on the Merrill side, 3/22/2020, the total retirement account balances were transferred into the Pre-Tax Merrill account.  Talking to Merrill, they informed me that if I correct it on their end, it would appear, on paper, that I am taking a distribution from a Pre-Tax account and funding a Roth initiating a taxable event.

Transfer was ""initiated"" on 3/19/2020 and my response was sent 3/20/2020.

&amp;#x200B;

It is now 5/26/2020 and they are talking me in circles.  Paychex and Merrill are at a loss of what to do and are telling me to seek the services of a tax attorney/CPA/CFA so that I can be made aware of all the possible tax implications for making any changes.  All I wanted was an apples to apples rollover of Pre-Tax and Roth to Pre-Tax and Roth.  One person has suggested a ""Distribution of excess contribution"" form backdated to the date of the ACH, another says Paychex needs to reclaim the asset then redistribute correctly.  I'm told the ""distribution of excess contribution"" will still make it look taxable on paper and Paychex says in not so many words ""sorry, we can no longer reclaim the ACH - you figure it out.""

&amp;#x200B;

What is frustrating is that they are making it seem like I am the first person, in the history of the world, that this has happened to and they cannot offer any solutions that don't involve me.  I've had Paychex, Merrill, and even brought Vanguard into the mix on conference lines to talk this out.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,"Hi PF, I've been scratching my head about this one and was hoping to get your input on whether or not it's worth it to convert some of my wife's old retirement accounts to a Roth IRA. I have a lot of questions but here's a little background to start: 

She recently changed jobs and has about $16K in two retirement accounts, a traditional 401k and a 403b. Her current job pays more; however, there is no employer sponsored retirement plan at the moment. It's a very small company and her boss may set up an employer sponsored retirement plan in the next 12 months but let's assume for the moment that this will not occur. Her plan as of now is to max out her Roth IRA each year and then I will likely increase my employee contribution to my Roth 401k so that we're saving \~15% of our total income for retirement. I already max out my Roth IRA. Additional important background to note: I'm a medical resident and in about 2 years my income will increase significantly and we will be ineligible to contribute directly to our Roth IRAs so will plan on doing backdoor Roth conversions each year. This is also important because right now we're very likely in the lowest tax bracket that we'll ever be in, including in retirement. Right now our combined income is \~$118,000 and for tax purposes we're married filing jointly.

So with that background, here are the options we have for the $16K:

1. **Leave it alone.** The investment options are decent with low expense ratios. I've called and confirmed that there are no maintenance fees to keep the money parked there now that she's not working for the old company. In retirement, we'll make withdrawals and pay taxes on the contributions and earnings (likely in a higher tax bracket than we are now). 
2. **Rollover to a Rollover IRA and leave it.** Would allow us to switch investments to very slightly better funds. Not ideal because in 2 years when we have to start making backdoor Roth IRA contributions, we'd get nailed with the pro-rata rule. Otherwise the same situation as above, it's pretax money so we'll pay taxes on contributions and earnings when we withdraw in retirement. 
3. **Rollover IRA then Roth IRA conversion.** Probably ideal from a long-term tax standpoint since we would let the money grow for 30-some-odd years and would not be taxed on earnings in retirement. However, for this tax year we'd be stuck paying taxes on an additional $16K of income however I don't think it would put us in a higher tax bracket. The big downside though is that we'd have to pay the additional taxes on the $16K with cash on hand which would mean saving up and potentially putting less money in our emergency fund or retirement accounts this year. Also, does converting to a Roth IRA count against your contribution limit for the year? I.e., would we not be able to convert the money all at once or would she not be able to contribute to her Roth at all?

personalfinance,"Hello all, I've seen a lot of valuable advice given here over the years and would appreciate any input into my wife and I's specific scenario if anyone has any advice.

I'm 29, my wife is 28, and we bought our first home about a year ago. We've done pretty well for ourselves thus far and were able to put 20% down with 15 year year financing. We bought the home for $442,000, ~$90k down, 3.75% interest rate. At the time, we were each making ~$115k annually for a total around $230k. I've gotten a slight raise, and my wife has switched jobs slightly lowering her income, but we're roughly around the same at $225k. Our mortgage payment every month, after taxes, insurance (escrow), etc, is $3,247. 

Our plan is to start trying to have kids within the next year or two. When the first child is born, my wife is planning to stop working for at least a few years. If we were to take our current financial situation, and remove my wife's income entirely, it would basically work out that half of my paycheck would now be going to the mortgage (my 2 week paycheck is very close to what the mortgage payment is, around $3200). Between the rest of our bills, food, credit cards (no CC debt, no debt in general besides the mortgage), we'd essentially be spending all of my income on life expenses for a few years until my wife began working again a few years down the road (she's a CPA so no real concern that she wouldn't be able to get a job).

We had started looking at refinancing at the beginning of the pandemic, just because rates were becoming so much better. We currently have a 3.75% rate on our 15 year mortgage, and can get a 2.75% rate on a 15 year mortgage - with all closing costs rolled into the cost of the mortgage (no money out of pocket), this still drops our monthly payment ~$200 a month. On the other hand, if we go for a 30 year mortgage, at 3.5%, it looks like the monthly cost is $785 less than the 2.75% 15 year mortgage, and if you tack on the additional $200 we were going to save from the 15 year refi, we would be saving roughly $1k a month to go 30 year, IF we needed the savings. My plan would be to continue paying $3300 or more per month even if we went 30 year, while we still can, because in general 30 year mortgages are a terrible investment where you're getting robbed on interest. My question is, is it worth it to have this fall-back, or should we just push forward with the 15 year re-fi and ""make it work"" when we have kids, with the savings inherent to a 15 year mortgage? Any advice from people who have been in this situation? We're currently all approved for the refi, and just need to sign the final paperwork - only in the last few days did I start debating possibly going with the 30 year for added future flexibility... 

An added wrinkle on top - we have a decent amount of savings. My wife and I have been diligently saving in order to get into real estate investing - I intend to buy a multifamily property to rent out within the next year or two, depending on whether I find the right deal. In terms of savings, we have ~$70k liquid currently that we were amassing to put towards a downpayment on a property, $25k I've put into the market over the past few months, another $50k in a managed stock account I wasn't planning on touching, and then our various 401k accounts. 

If I wasn't determined to move towards financial independence via real estate investing, and these funds were just standard savings, I would be a lot less hesitant to just refi to the improved 15 year mortgage - we're planning to save another $80-100k this year, and these savings could carry us through a few years of my wife not working with kids. But given that we want to use them towards an investment property, one that hopefully will generate at least $1k of cash flow per month (we were under contract on a deal like this 3 months ago but unforseen last minute property issues caused us to pull out during the inspection period), I want to make sure that we get this refi right - we don't plan on staying in this house forever, but 5 to 8 years is probably reasonable... Sorry if I'm just incoherently rambling at this point, just don't want to lock in a refi with back-end costs added to the mortgage, only to regret the decision in 12 to 24 months....","Refi 15 year mortgage to 15 year, or 30 year + extra payments?

personalfinance,"I know this has been asked a million times and I know the financially correct answer is to invest in tax advantaged accounts. Our problem is that we purchased a starter home and want to upgrade to a ""forever"" home before our son starts school (He was born late last year). First I'll quickly layout our financial picture (we are in our late 20's with 1 child):

* Income: Together we make \~126k
* Debt: $155,000 @ 4.75% mortgage but that's it, we own both our cars (they will last long, 2017 and 2018), student loans are paid off, pay off cards at the end of every month
* E-Fund: 20k which is \~10 months worth of expenses if we both lose our jobs
* As of now we have an extra 4k/month coming in
* We currently put up to our full match for both our work plans (TSP and a 403b) but have &lt;20k in each
* I'll mention just for context that we are very debt averse

With the money we have coming in we can pay off our mortgage in just about 3-5 years (giving into account sometimes having to use the extra 4k on other things like refilling e-fund), sell the house and put whatever profit that we get selling it into the down payment on the next one. (We want to purchase something that is \~400k or whatever that is with inflation in 5 years). My thought is that instead of putting the money for the new house in a HYS account we would just pay the mortgage down aggressively saving 4.75% in interest. If we were to max our retirement accounts we would not have access to the money which would make it harder to purchase the house before my son is school age.

personalfinance,,Does anyone have experience renting a room from a live-in family? Any tips and advice?
personalfinance,"Hi PF, happy summer to all.  I've found myself at a bit of a crossroads and I need some advice from the finance side of the very multi-faceted dilemma that I'm facing.  First, here's some background about me:

I'm 35M, wifey is 34F.  We have two kids, 7F and 3M.  We live in Indianapolis right now but have talked very seriously about moving to California (Sacramento area, mostly) for several reasons, such as weather, cultural environment, education, things to do, etc.  We had basically decided to do it at the beginning of the year but things have been stymied considerably by coronavirus.

Here's a brief overview of our finances:

* We owe $155k ($1,250 per month payment, 4.25% interest, no PMI) on our house right now, and could reasonably expect to sell it for $260-275k.  
* We have two cars, one paid off and one with a payment that we owe about $10k on.  Minimum payment is $3xx but we've paid $500 per month since we bought it.    
* We have about $12k of credit card debt, which includes $4k for the new AC we had to buy for the house last week.  All of the credit cards are at 0% interest right now.  Those promotions expire at various times later this year (except the AC one, that's 24 months from now).
* Student loan payments for both of us together total about $750 per month.
* We have $11k in cash savings.
* Household income is $110k right now; my salary is $73k and hers is $37k.

So, the original plan was to sell our house in Indy, pocket somewhere between $60-100k in proceeds from the sale, and move to Sacramento (after I found a job, of course).  That is still one of the options, but the pandemic has raised a lot of questions: what happens if I get a job but my wife has a hard time finding one?  What happens if we move across the country and then I get laid off?  What happens if this recession gets a lot worse and/or causes a housing crash and we find ourselves with a house that is worth a lot less than we paid for it?  On the other hand, if things don't completely fall apart in Sacramento, we will be in a great position to build wealth there: the housing market seems to be in great shape and on its way up due to the massive influx of migration from other, more expensive parts of California.  So, whatever house we buy there could appreciate significantly over the next decade or so.  This would, of course, only be helped along by the dirt-cheap mortgage rate that we'd be able to get right now.  I'd be able to pay off the car and credit card debt prior to moving and situate my family very nicely for long-term financial stability.  Plus, I'd be in California instead of Indiana, which is basically like a dream to me.  I am *not* happy in the Midwest at all; let's just leave it at that.

Another option is to give up on moving to Cali and stay in Indianapolis, but sell our house and move somewhere else locally.  The main advantage to doing that would be that we'd be able to cash out our significant (to us) home equity and use some of that money to upgrade our financial situation: car loan and credit cards would be gone, and we could take advantage of the dirt-cheap mortgage rates.  Basically the same as above, but in Indy instead.  I wouldn't get the benefit of the higher rate of appreciation on a more expensive house, but I'd still be taking advantage of current mortgage rates. 

The third option would be to just stay put and ride out the pandemic in relative comfort and then reevaluate when things are more stable.  Things are undeniably comfortable here right now, and it's not like we're throwing a lot of money away on interest, so the debt isn't a huge emergency.  Either way, we're gradually paying things off and will likely be out of debt in the next couple of years.  If nothing else changes, we'll be considerably better off in about a year when our son ages out of daycare and we get to stop paying for that (it's cheap - only $120/week - but it's still one of our biggest monthly bills).  By that time, the car loan will be only a few months away from being paid off as well.  Once those bills are both gone, the credit cards will be easy to pay off.  

I've thought about refinancing, cash-out or not, but the juice doesn't seem to be worth the squeeze: it would cost thousands in fees and closing costs to do it, and the gain doesn't seem to be super worth it.  Besides, I don't want to pay credit card balances and a car loan from now for the next five, ten, whatever, years.  That seems stupid to me.

I tend to be a bit less conservative that the prevailing opinion on PF, but the sober and unemotional take that I'm expecting to get here is valuable to me.  I'm almost certain I'm missing something that y'all will quickly point out, so hit me with your best shot.

personalfinance,"In the early 2010s I came into a relatively small windfall in the form of an inheritance. At the time I was in college; a friend connected me with a financial advisor, and I parked $10k in a Roth IRA and put the rest into mutual fund investments. In 2016 I cashed out the funds for a down payment on a house but the IRA remains.

In the last few years I've spent a lot of time lurking on this sub and began more aggressively attempting to get my finances in order with the Snowball method. Since the IRA value is approaching where it was before the pandemic crash, I'm wondering if I would be better served withdrawing my $10k in post-tax contributions and using it on something else. 

I can easily afford all of my monthly payments, so this would not be a crisis withdrawal, just wondering if the funds are better served elsewhere. Currently I am focusing my overpayments on the HELOC balance to the tune of about ~$1500 a month.

My plan was to knock out the HELOC by the end of summer, then focus on the car loan, then my student loans. If I were to withdraw my Roth contributions, I could knock out the HELOC immediately and take a big chunk out of the car loan (and possibly even eliminate that by the end of summer) and then focus 100% on eliminating my student debt once interest accrual resumes in September. Would this be worth doing or should I leave the money parked in the Roth IRA?

Here's where I stand:

$92,000 balance on mortgage at 3.625% (not worried about this, I got the house for a song and my $850 all-in monthly payment is much less than renting in my area)
$7,400 balance on HELOC at 4.99%
$17,900 balance on car loan at 4.24%
$31,000 balance on student loans currently at 0% (mix of loans at 3.5% and 6.5%)

Given these numbers, is my $10k currently parked in the IRA better served elsewhere, or should I let it be for now?","With values back on the rise, worth withdrawing contributions from Roth IRA to settle other debts?"

personalfinance,"Hi Reddit!

I'm about to refinance, but I'm struggling with a few \[more\] questions:

1. Related to locking rates: When I submit and lenders do a hard pull I know I have 2 weeks to compete lenders. In that amount of time the June unemployment rate will be announced.  Is there a time that strategically I should submit everything and do the hard pull so that if the unemployment rate is higher (and the mortgage rates drop)  I can take advantage? Not sure how this works so that simultaneously if the rates jump I'll be protected (are you able to float/lock multiple times within the two-week period).
2. If I rolled my PMI into my initial mortgage is that a part of the loan forever? *Background: our mortgage is only two years old but we should have 20% equity in the home after all of our updates.*",Refinance rate lock + PMI questions

personalfinance,"My husband and I are first time home buyers, and we have Asperger's Syndrome. To say that we're nervous and lost about this process is an understatement.

Basically, we aren't actively looking at houses, but one that we admire in our neighborhood is now for sale. We're going to talk to a loan officer from our bank this afternoon about preapproval, and I sent a message to the real estate agent on Zillow to ask about a tour (I don't know if I did that correctly, and I am thinking about looking her up and contacting her directly if I don't hear from her soon).

As I understand it, we should get a real estate agent to represent us as the buyers, but since we didn't find this house through one (and aren't necessarily planning to shop around otherwise), I don't know how to go about it.

Also, we have more than enough for a 20% downpayment, but that is a big part of my husband's only retirement savings (I have been on his case about just letting it sit in savings). On the loan application we mentioned that we do have money for a downpayment, but would it be smarter to do a lower down option so he isn't losing that money? He is in his 40s, and isn't otherwise in good shape to retire on time I think.


**tl;dr: 
1. How do I get a buyer's real estate agent if I already know what house I want?
2. We have the money for a downpayment, but we don't want to spend it. Is that possible/smart here?**

I get paid on the 15th &amp; 30th of each month. I have a CC payment and some other payments that are due closer to the end of each month. When I get paid on the 30th, and make payments to those creditors at the end of the month, does that come out of June’s budget, or May’s budget? Does that make sense?

personalfinance,"In september I'm gonna be studying for the first time. I'm gonna be studying IT, with a focus on either cybercrime or artificial intelligence. I'm confident that I'm gonna finish this study, the entry level jobs I can get when I'm done start at around 2500 euros gross/month, with a lot of potential for growth.

Right now, I have no savings, and get by on government support since lockdown started. My monthly costs are around €850 right now, and I project them to go up to around €1000 when I'm studying. 

I can borrow money from the government for my study in two forms. One is the ""studiefinanciering"", a loan at 0% interest, which I can pay back in 35 years. The maximum amount I can borrow is €1047 a month. 

The other one is a supplementary grant (aanvullende beurs). I expect this one to be around €350-400 a month, and this will turn into a gift if I graduate within 5 years (my study takes 4, normally). 

All in all, this is what it would look like

Income:



Type | Amount
---|---
0% loan | €1047
supplementary grant | €350
healthcare aid | €108
Total | €1505


Expenses:

Type | Amount
---|---
rent | €423
Groceries | €200
Study costs | €149
health insurance | €117
phone plan | €60
other misc stuff | €50
total | €999

So my idea is, I could ""save"" about €500 a month, half of which I would want to invest in something long term, and half of which I would like to have on a savings account just to have a bit of a buffer (possibly shifting this percentage more towards the long term investment once I feel confident in my buffer). The downside would be that I would finish my study and have a bigger debt to pay back.

What do you guys think? Does my train of thought make sense? Borrow the maximum amount and invest/save it? What would you do and why? 

Thanks so much in advance.","Starting a study, should I borrow the maximum amount from the government and invest/save what I don't spend, or borrow what I need? (NL)"

Note: I’m going to keeping using this $100 vs $25 example for the sake of conversation. 

I hate that this option exists, both from the psychological advantages they take (“$100 is expensive... but I can afford  $25!”) as well the financial ones- 
• Maxed our cards/low credit limit: consumers who can’t put $100 on their cards but can put $25 just found a way to put themselves further into debt 
• No credit checks: according to an interview I read with Klarna, they judge your credit-worthiness off of what you’re buying and the device you’re buying from (what generation iPhone or what laptop you’re using, if you’re buying a physics books or a Nintendo Switch)
• Some charge interest (Affirm): the 15% interest rate may be lower than some consumers’ credit card interest rates, so they might think they’re getting a good deal 
• Those who don’t charge interest upfront: I’d bet that most consumers who use this “service” are the same ones who keep revolving debt on cards, so the interest/late fees are imminent

personalfinance,"So we applied for loan forbearance with our mortgage company (Dovenmuehle). We were approved, which was a nice relief (my wife's salary is reduced a bit right now. We could make our payments but with all the uncertainty, figured it'd be nice to set that money aside for now instead).

We got the agreement in the mail and saw that it said you have to pay it back in September. We had heard of this happening, but thought it was too ridiculous and unhelpful to be the reality for us, but here we are.

First, what the hell does that help? You can't pay your mortage but you can pay thousands of extra dollars all at once in a few months?

Anyway, I called them to see if we could do the sane option of just extending the loan term by 3 months, and they said that we can call back 10 days before the end of the forbearance agreement to apply to modify the loan. I said ""okay, so it's not even guaranteed then?"" and she said that's correct but she ""doesn't see why we wouldn't be approved"".

That's not very comforting.

So we were thinking, with interest rates the way they are, we might just refinance now. Like I said, we could make our payments at this point. My job is secure..my wife's isn't in great shape right now, but she's still employed and it seems she will stay that way.

I was also just thinking I might call our company back and let them know that we're thinking of refinancing and will go with another company if they can't help us out this one time.

personalfinance,"Hi Reddit! I recently got approved for my first credit card to use for shared expenses between my boyfriend and I (groceries, toilet paper, etc.) at home. I had a pretty good credit score (759), but after about a month it dropped by 80 points. I was racking my brain trying to figure out what happened, because the payment wasn’t due yet, although I did pay it off early, so it wasn’t a missed payment. After some research, I realized that my utilization score is likely through the roof, as my credit limit is a measly 500 dollars, and we spent close to 450 before I paid it. However, I’m not sure how I can fix this, because my credit account is too new To apply for a credit increase, but 500 is incredibly small, and if I only spent 30% of my credit limit for a lower utilization, I wouldn’t be spending enough to get the rewards on the card (cash back if we spend 500 in 3 months). Should I pay off the card more frequently to keep the usage lower? And how quickly can I get my score back up? Any other advice is appreciated.","First credit card, FICO score dropped 80 points"

personalfinance,"Let me preface this by making one thing clear: I'm not some lazy freeloader. I was a College student up until February, where I had to drop out due to performing poorly on my exams. No, it wasn't due to ""unwillingness to study"", the course I had choosen was too difficult for me to finish (Engineering), even though I've poured hours of studying and doing homework in order to pass. For this reason I wasn't able to get a job during my college years, due to the fact that i would spend entire days at the library studying, so much that I even lost friendships because of it.

Other things I've done in the past to get out of this situation are: Apply for trade schools, (wasn't able to finish due to not being physically strong enough to pass some of the internships), sent in countless resumès to get a job,  travelled to a different country in order to find a job (where I worked as a dishwasher for a month).

My family is abusive. I don't say this to try and get some sympathy here, I say this because I can't stay here or my sanity will keep getting worse. My father is physically abusive and my mom hates me and enables him.

I have tried sending my resumè for different jobs but it is insanely difficult where I live to find a job with no education other than your highschool diploma and almost no job experience. I have applied to many jobs, including cleaner, dishwasher, cashier, call-center worker etc..and I am still sending my resumè to them.

For anyone who thinks that my parents should just kick me out, I would just end up homeless. My parents have already tried in the past that and I spent almost a week sleeping outside and rummaning for food. There was no point in doing that other than mentally scarring me, because I'm not unwilling to be indipendent, I am already actively looking for a job, and it is hard to get a job while being homeless, since most require you to at least have access to a vehicle and specify where you live. 

I also am worried about the future. Like I said I don't have the bests family situation here, so I can't depend on their financial help forever. I have no relatives near where I live and no friends that could help me. I need a job that will help me be indipendent, not just right now but in the future. Working minimum wage jobs such as cashier here don't pay nearly enough for me to live on my own (only 600 euros) and I'm scared I might end up homeless one day if I keep working jobs that pay low wages.

personalfinance,"I'm a recent college graduate who was thrusted into the world of financial independence 6 months ago. 

While I've had a bank account for a few years, I did not have a credit card, so in January I applied for one through my bank and was accepted. 

Since then I have been using the card responsibly for the sole purpose of raising my credit score for when the time comes for me to take out a car loan, or mortgage. I've used it each month for around ~$250-$300 of gas and groceries and have paid it off the first day each statement is available. I have not missed a payment and have paid in full each time.

This seemed to have worked, and from January to April my credit score steadily rose from 690 where I was started, to 725. As of yesterday when I checked, I noticed my score had actually fallen from April-May from 725 to 718. While this doesn't really matter, I am trying to find out why it may have so I can correct whatever the issue may be. It is frustrating as the only reason I have the credit card is to raise my score, so if that's not happening, what's the point?  

I have been checking my credit score through my banking app. It updates monthly. I'm unsure how accurate it is and if these fluctuations are just normal. The bank is BoA, and the credit data comes from Trans Union.

The only causes I can think are:

*my credit card somehow cracked in my wallet so I ordered a replacement in May, if this can affect it. I did not open a new account or anything, just a replacement card while I used the other with duct tape in the mean time. Does getting a replacement card affect credit score?

*this is somehow related to my student loans, even though I know for certain my grace period does not end until June 19th with my first payment due by July. All I have done regarding loans recently was sign up for an autopay system for when that begins.

*I was approved for a new apartment back in March with my first prorated rent due in mid June (was going to pay it June 1st). So it is either the fact I have not paid the prorated rent yet (they said I had until they day I moved in) or maybe they ran a credit check on me in March/April and that affected it (which my sister said it could). 

Any and all advice on what might have caused it, if I should worry, and how I could find out for myself is appreciated! I am trying to be as proactive and responsible as I can from the get-go, so a little ""set back"" like this is disheartening, like I'm doing something wrong.

I make $35/hour. Work 40 hours a week paid every 2 weeks. So i believe that means 26 paychecks, for a total of $72,800 before taxes.

In that $72,800, ~~$60 is deducted per paycheck for health insurance.

I plan for 2020 was to contribute $6k to traditional IRA, $3550 to my HSA, and just enough to my traditional 401k (no employer match at all btw) to get me 12% tax bracket, before finishing off with roth 401k contributions.

this meant, $72,800 gross. $60 per paycheck = $1,560 total. Gross $71,240 before taxes after health insurance.

Take standard deduction of 12,400 so $58,840 tax liability. $3550 (HSA) + $6000 (Trad IRA) = 9550 deduction

$58,840 - HSA - Trad IRA = $49,290. 12% tax bracket ends at $40,125. which means I can put $9,165 to Traditional 401k before Ill be in the 12% tax bracket. After $9,165, i can contribute the rest to my Roth 401k for 12% tax bracket.

So far, I have already made the HSA and traditional IRA contribution. And about $8000 in my traditional 401k. However, it turns out with my income I dont qualify for 100% IRA deductions?

personalfinance,"   Boglehead here, and my company switched from a very expensive retirement plan that was charging 2.5% per transaction as well as yearly maintenance fees to a new provider, to an Empower retirement 401a.  I need help choosing percentages and which funds.

   The jist of the plan is we have 19-20ish funds to choose from not counting the garbage American target date funds. We have to keep a minimum of 2500$ in this ""core fund bucket"". The fidelity index funds have my attention.

   It also has the option of also having a self directed brokerage account (50$/yr to have this) as long as we keep 2500$ in the core fund bucket. so we can have both if we want.

   There are no fees to buy or sell if we do it online. Only fees are if you choose to pay for an advisor/manager or use call in to have someone to make purchases.

   I will have to use both as i have a good chunk of Microsoft/apple/QQQ/SPY (pre-boglehead days) as well as VTI/VXUS/BND being transferred over in kind.  

   I could just throw 2500$ into one of the core funds. and sweep all future contributions to the brokerage and log in every 2 weeks and continue buying the VTI/VXUS/BND. But the core funds have a neat feature where you select your funds and it has slider bars to set the percentages you want and it autoinvests each pay period essentially set and forget, check once a year. I am also thinking about liquidating QQQ/SPY and putting it into the 3 fund to simplify things.

Will going with the Fidelity 500, international, and bond be sufficient? or should i be adding in small/mid/emerging and if so at what %.

Looking for some advice as I move into the purchase of my second home.  I've been relocated for work to a different state and and I'm currently renting in said state.  Annual income right now is 78k per year, which will bump to 92k in fall 2020 and 110k in fall 2021.  No debts other than mortgage.

First home:  Remaining principal is $26,000 at 3% on a 15 year fixed mortgage with about 7 years left on the payments, redfin/zillow estimate current value at $208,000.   Monthly payment is $580, currently renting this home for $1050 per month ($945 after property manager fee).

Second Home:  In closing right now for $307,000 at 3.375% on a 30 year fixed with 5% down.  Payments are looking to be about $1,700 per month.

I'm curious if I should look to sell the first house and refinance the 30 year fixed on the second house?   
 Or continue to rent it.  The current renters are contracted for another year, so I would either be able to dump a lump payment into the 30 year or look to refinace.

Thoughts?  Thanks.",Second Home Purchase

personalfinance,"Hi all, I'm currently 3 years into my mortgage (4% interest rate, 30 year fixed).  With the current interest rate climate, I've been looking into refinancing, and my current credit union is offering my 3.625% for another 30 year fixed (with negative 1/8 point, $1650 closing costs).  It will take me about 5 months to break even with the closing costs, so I decided to go forward with the application process.  However, now I'm looking at my amortization schedule and realizing that if I keep this house for the full 30 year term of the mortgage, my total interest charges will be slightly higher for the refinance vs keeping the current mortgage (i.e. I added the interest I've already paid over the last 3 years + the interest I'll pay over the 30 years for the new mortgage and it is slightly more than the total interest I would pay if I keep the current mortgage for the remaining 27 years).  I know this makes sense because I'm extending the length of the mortgage by another 3 years, but wonder if I should be trying to decrease the overall finance charges lower for it to make sense?

I don't intend to stay in this house for 30 years, so maybe the above calculations don't matter and I should be looking at the interest paid over the time I expect to stay in the house.   I thought saving $300/month on my mortgage looked appealing (this is about a 10% lower monthly  P+I payment) but am wondering if there are other metrics I should look at when deciding whether refinancing make sense.  

Just in case anyone questions the rate I'm being given, I'm not sure why I can't find anything near as good as the rates I see people posting about here, but I suspect it's because I'm looking at jumbo loans (I have &gt;760 credit and &gt;20% equity though) or perhaps location plays a factor as well.",Does this mortgage refinance make sense?

I looked at Upstart via Credit Karma and figured out that they Offer: $10000 loan, ~11% APR, 60 month term with an estimated monthly payment of $221. Wow! That’s a considerable amount of savings!

personalfinance,"TLDR: If a child inherits a large IRA could an abusive parent transfer the money away from the child and into bitcoin (or another asset) using only the child's bank username and password and perhaps 2FA?

&amp;#x200B;

An older friend (78 M) is planning to will a large IRA to his 3 grandchildren. I fear he's not getting great estate planning advice because he's not putting the money in any kind of custodial trust, instead just naming the grandchildren directly. These kids range in age from 11 to 16 so conceivably an 11 year old could have direct control of a six-figure inheritance.

Adding to the risk, the 11 year-old's mother (my friend's daughter) is divorced and the child's father is an addict who was manipulative, abusive and extremely irresponsible with money.

I've tried to persuade the friend that an 11 year old child would be too easily manipulated by his father and that if the child alone has control of the money he could be tricked by his father into signing it over to him or spending it on him. The child's father is also active in bitcoin mining and transfers and I advised my friend that the father might not even have to convince the boy -- he might only need the boy's password to whatever account the money ends up in and he could use it to purchase bitcoin for himself. While the father transferring funds out of the boy's account would presumably be illegal, there would likely be no way of proving that the bitcoin funds ended up with the father.

My friend believes that such a large transfer out of an IRA would require some additional confirmation such as a phone call or in-person visit but I'm not sure (and of course I also think that's a terrible thing to rely on for protecting the assets).

I'm certainly interested in the larger issue of whether not having a custodian/trustee to protect the child's inheritance is wise but also more immediately am I correct in thinking that for some or all banks a username/password and maybe a texted second factor would be enough for the father to access and transfer the funds away from the child's control? Would it make any difference if the money remains in an IRA? In some ways I feel like this could be worse because if the father liquidates the IRA and converts that money to bitcoin the child will still owe income taxes on the distribution from the IRA.

personalfinance,"My sister (26, F) and I (23, M) have brought up potentially buying a condo/townhouse/ other smaller residential property in the DC Area, most likely NoVA (Arlington Or Alexandria most likely).

Neither of us is super urgent on doing it, but I believe I will be in the area for at least 5ish years at a minimum, and while she does not currently live in the area, I believe there is a high probability she moves back to the DC area in 2-3 years.

Rent Prices in DC/NoVA are dumb expensive. We think that potentially buying a place with a mortgage could be a good long term-investment/housing decision. Our belief is that one or both of us will probably be using it over the next 5-10 years, and could find a roommate if only one of us. If neither of us, we could put it up for rent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Facts/Stats/Financial tendencies - (23, M)

* 60k annual income (24 bi monthly paychecks)
* no student or credit card debt
* 20k in Roth IRA, 20k in brokerage (target date funds)
* 7k in savings.
* monthly rent including parking and utilities - $1500
* credit score - 750+, my dad is big into FI and got us CCs when we were 18 to build credit.

I currently put away 250/paycheck to my roth401k (6k annualized), and 150/paycheck to my savings. I also put 100/paycheck to an HSA.

I am unsure about my sister - i believe she makes 70-80k, with a similar savings and prob closer to 50/60k in investments. No debt.

I also like to max out my roth every year, which would potentially come from my savings (would like to keep 7.5k as emergency fund) . I am new to the workforce, i dont think my job gives bonuses to entry level which would be a nice thing to use for the roth.

I know this has been long winded, but just wanted the details of the situation to give the best context for advice. My main questions/concerns are

1. What should our price range be? 
   1. I was thinking 250-500k, however for Arlington/Alexandria, to get one with metro access may be better to try for 600 or 700?
2. Do you think this is a wise decision?
   1. I hate shelling out 1500/month for rent, I think what entices me is potentially having a mortgage payment under 2k (1k/person), despite that downpayment.
3. What are the associated risks with renting?
   1. I know we have to be the ""landlords"" and could have bad tenants. But what if we had good tenants and got our mortgage paid off by the renters? what other unforeseen costs and expenses should i be thinking about/preparing for if we do this.

Walking distance of several beautiful parks, elementary school, middle school, high school, the Saturday Market, 8 minute drive from a great hospital, the children's museum, the zoo, etc.) The neighborhood is very low crime also and we love the rain (we're oddballs we know).

Here's the doozie though... We had to file for chapter 7 just over a year ago to take care of the $48,000 credit card debt we accumulated while raising two kids (our third was on the way at the time) and going to college full time. I worked two part time jobs at that time too but did not make enough to make ends meet. We learned from that situation, however and are making things right from here on out.

On top of my paycheck my wife receives $1,230 a month from SSI for the next 5 - 7 years until she is reevaluated (her condition should remain the same so I don't see this amount going away in the near future). I know I have to wait at least two years until the banks will risk loaning me money for a house (I looked that up) but we have 1 credit card to help rebuild our credit and have credit scores in the low 600s now (was 419 just a few months ago).

Guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it).

Our other monthly bills aren’t crazy, just car stuff, gas and oil changes occasionally, cell phone bill, internet bill, and electricity and water bills. We don’t spend crazy or lavishly, just kid stuff like diapers, clothes, and a few toys. We both have laptops and two tablets for schoolwork for the kids, but other than that no crazy man cave or gaming setup or custom built computer, etc. (I do have a semi large board game collection but that has been built up over time). In-laws have occasionally talked about “helping out” in us getting a house but I don’t know in what way and want to rely on myself as much as possible…

personalfinance,"I recently took on a second job which brings in an additional $1k a month but is only for the next few months. That on top of the lockdown, I haven't been spending as much so I have extra cash at the end of each month. I currently have a $36k student loan at 4.5%, \~$2-3k on credit cards that I pay off each month, no rollover, essentially a year emergency fund and am almost maxed out with my roth for 2020. 

So where do I put the extra money? Current loan payment is $400 a month. On track to pay off in 9 years. No other loans or monthly financial obligations. Do I dump more money into the student loans or into my other fidelity account \[FZROX\] or ally savings account?

personalfinance,"Cross post from r/DaveRamsey

I am in a situation to withdraw 100k from 401(k) RSP (Retirement Savings Plan) that seems too good to be true. So I need an advice to understand if I should withdraw money from RSP to pay off part of my home loan.

First my financial info, though. We're a family of 4. We have no debt except for home loan. I make 245k annually, and use credit cards for day-to-day expenses (I know I'm not supposed to, but I have automatic payments to pay off full statement-balance every month). The remaining principal on home loan is 283k. Feel free to ask if anything else might be pertinent to the question.

I had about 197k in my RSP; in the Covid-19 crash, it shrunk down to 136k, and is now back to 183k. A few days ago I received a notice from Fidelity (see below) which says that due to CARES act, I can withdraw up to 100k ***without*** the usual 10% penalty.

It's the tax implications that I am not sure of. The document says ""You may choose to pay income taxes on a CARES Act withdrawal over a three-year period"". A very loose interpretation would mean I don't have to pay taxes if I don't want to; but a strict interpretation would mean that I have to pay taxes on the amount I withdraw.

I am thinking of withdrawing 100k and paying down my home loan, and am wondering if it's a bad idea or if there's a catch that I might have missed. Did anyone else on this forum get such a letter from their employer or 401(k) plan? Would you/Dave advise me take this step, or should I stay the course and keep paying down the principal from my monthly savings.

EDIT: The particularly interesting bit is ""You may also choose to repay the amount within three years to the RSP or another eligible retirement account as a rollover contribution."" And I intend to save and deposit 100k back into RSP over the next 3 years. Normally adding more than annual eligible amount (about 19k) is not allowed, but if I understand this clause correctly, I am allowed to deposit extra into 401 (k)/RSP to make up the 100k I intend to withdraw.

PS: I fall under one of the eligibility criteria. But since no paperwork is required, I guess everyone in my company can use this opportunity to withdraw 100k. Should I encourage my friends/colleagues, who may not fall under the eligibility criteria, to take advantage of this opportunity?

PPS: Using a throwaway account since I don't want my current financial info to follow me and stick around on the internet for all eternity.

**Relevant parts of the letter from Fidelity:**

New legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, was recently passed by Congress to help ease some of the financial impact of the COVID‐19 crisis.

Accordingly, you may take penalty-free CARES Act withdrawals of up to $100,000during 2020 and request CARES Act deferment of 2020 loan repayments as an RSP participant if you meet one of the following eligibility criteria:

\- You are diagnosed with the virus SARS-Co-V-2 or with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a test approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or

\- Your spouse or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code) is diagnosed with such virus or disease by such a test, or

\- You experience adverse financial consequences as a result of being quarantined, being furloughed or laid off or having work hours reduced due to such virus or disease, being unable to work due to lack of child care due to such virus or disease, closing or reducing hours of a business owned or operated by you due to such virus or disease, or other factors as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

**CARES Act withdrawals**

\- If you meet one of the above criteria, you may take withdrawals of up to $100,000 in total through December 30, 2020.  This total limit applies to all CARES Act withdrawals from the RSP and any other retirement plan (including an individual retirement plan, such as an IRA).  - There is no minimum dollar amount or maximum number of CARES Act withdrawals you may take.

\- Withdrawals are taken on a pro-rata basis from eligible vested amounts attributable to each type of contribution in your RSP account, except for money purchase amounts.  Unlike regular withdrawals, if your CARES Act withdrawal includes matched after-tax savings that have been in the RSP for less than two years, your matching contributions will not be suspended for 6 months.

\- No 10% early withdrawal tax penalty will apply to a CARES Act withdrawal.

\- You may choose to pay income taxes on a CARES Act withdrawal over a three-year period.   You may also choose to repay the amount within three years to the RSP or another eligible retirement account as a rollover contribution.

**CARES Act loan repayment deferment**

&lt;skipping, since I don't have a loan on my RSP&gt;

...

In addition, the IRS has issued guidance to allow for certain extensions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These extensions are available even if you do not meet the eligibility criteria for CARES Act withdrawals and loan repayment deferment.

**Rollover timing**

If you take a distribution between February 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020, you may complete an indirect rollover of the distribution into an eligible retirement account by July 15, 2020to avoid paying income tax on that amount.  (Normally, the indirect rollover must be completed within 60 days.)  This extension includes any distributions that were made due to the IRS “minimum distribution” rules.

It's just one of those things we need to accept.  But what makes it tough is that we have a huge house, about 3,000 sq ft.  And I hate having to cool down THE ENTIRE THING on a daily basis just to get our bedroom to a likable temperature.  We've closed every vent in the house not going to the bedroom but just due to how the trunk lines are arranged, the rest of the house still gets a lot of cold air.

My 98 volvo with 190,000 miles recently shit out, I’ve had it since I was 16 (21 now) 

I’m looking for a new car, and I’m interested in the 2020 Volvo s60, mainly because I have experience with Volvos and their reliability, as well as it’s appearance. With taxes and everything it comes out to be about $39k, 0% apr for 60 months.

personalfinance," I've been shopping around for a  refinance on a home purchased last year.  I'm one year into my current  30 year loan at a rate of 4.375%.

This  is the best of a few offers I've been able to get.  I was able to get  this locked in, but my wife and I haven't signed any paper to go through  with it yet.  I'm reading through the closing cost worksheet and  wondered if my understanding is correct.  I also thought others might  benefit from going over these costs together.

Here's my notes and assumptions in the borders of the screen shot.  I'll number the items to make the discussion easier.

Screen shot:  [https://i.postimg.cc/fbrKrYsN/cost-of-loan2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fbrKrYsN/cost-of-loan2.jpg)

Headline  numbers:  On the remaining $199k principle balance of my loan, this  bank is offering a 15 year 2.75%.  Their percent for a 30 year loan was  3.0%, so I opted for the 15 year loan.  I'm comfortable with the monthly  payment.

1. They took out the $1629 ""normal"" fee they usually charge.  ok, great.
2. They  list the appraisal fee, but said it was not needed, and took it out the  bottom #4.  Kind of strange way of listing that on the closing  worksheet, right?  Ok, whatever.
3. The  rest of the $2144 fees are coming mostly from lender's title insurance,  settlement/closing cost, state tax/stamps.  Are those things I can  negotiate?  Are others getting their lender to paid for those things?   Like...why am I paying for their lender insurance?
4. see #2 above.
5. Do  I need to scrutinize the prepaid/reserve section?  They're my escrow  for property tax and home insurance.  I'm going to have to paid these  anyways right?  I'm currently es-crowing with my current loan.  I've  never thought much about these since they're things I'd paid anyways.   Do people ever get ripped off on these?  Like the lender collects more  money than actually was needed?  Does the daily interest make sense?

If  people ever do get ripped off here, I think it would be pretty easy to  do.  It's hard to figure out the exact numbers, how many months into the  tax year, what's left of the taxes/insurance that hasn't been paid for.

6.  So to get down to determining the real cost of the refinance, is it just the $2144 subtract appraisal fee of $475 = $1669?

There's still that little nagging in the back of my mind that I should pay one last payment to my current lender. I'm worried that if I don't, it'll mess up my credit. Has anyone experienced this before?

personalfinance,"My wife and I moved into a new house last September. Our mortgage is a 30 year jumbo at 3.625. With rates so low and all of the discussion on here about refinancing, we started looking into it ourselves. 

Our initial outreach to local lenders hasn't been super fruitful- everyone seems slammed with more refi business than they can handle. Also, the ballpark rates we've seen hasn't been much lower than we have now, like around 3.5. I was hoping for something below 3!

Is that worth the cost and hassle of refinancing? And, are there lower rates out there to be had for jumbo's?

Thanks!","What's the ""break even"" point for refinancing?"
personalfinance,"So here's the deal, I've accepted a position in my home town and I'm wanting to buy a house. I'll be going into my 6th year of teaching and I've rented the past 5 years. I estimate my income should be 49-50K. I live in a small community of about 2K people so the homes are very limited right now. 

There are some homes that are in the flood plain which I'd like to avoid, there is an older home on a slab that I'd like to avoid, there is a home that has a sagging roof that I'd like to avoid there are some home that are almost 100 years old that I'd like to avoid, you get the point.

There is ONE home that I'm really interested in. It's appraised at 135K and there was an elderly woman living in it who just got moved to the retirement home. Her family is now in control of the home and I had heard from one of her caregivers that the family is interested in selling the home. I did visit the home and talked with a family member on the phone from out of state. The home is very nice and in a nice neighborhood. Over sized attached 2 car garage, full unfinished basement, corner lot, 3 bed 2 bath great resale value and honestly if it was modernized a bit on the inside it could probably resell now for \~150K. Based on my phone conversation with the family I THINK I could get the home for 120K or more likely 125K possibly with some appliances included as well.

I have followed Dave Ramsey and themoneyguys for years and I know Dave says your home shouldn't be greater than 25% of your take home pay on a 15 year fixed. If I bought this home I'd have to do a 30 year fixed and my parents would help with 20% down to avoid PMI. 

Interest rates are really low now and my mortgage would probably only be $422 with a 100K loan at 3%. Property taxes would be roughly $225 (ugh) and I'm checking on homeowner's insurance tomorrow but I'd guess around $100. This would put my payments at roughly $750 / month and I'm guessing 25% of my take home pay would be somewhere around $700 or 725 so it's very close but I'm OVER the 25% take home pay guideline. I am single and would like to get married at some point so if another income ever does come into play that would definitely help. I know it's just that (a guideline) but I hate to overextend myself.

I'm sure I could probably eventually get into a home that is 75K-90K that I'd be happy with but honestly it probably wouldn't include a basement, it'd likely be older and not in as nice of a neighborhood. Also, likely wouldn't have the double car garage, be as well constructed or sit on a large lot.

Thoughts? I think the family doesn't want to deal with a realtor and have the house sit on the market. Should I try to buy it through them or am I overextending myself? Should I just rent and wait for something cheaper that would be suitable?",Home buying: Would I be stretching my budget too much?
personalfinance,"My wife and I are 30 y/o, have 2 toddlers, gross $115,000, and have $127,000 equity in our $175,000 home.


We are looking to move but fear of fees and being house poor are getting in the way of me making the move. I grew up in a low-middle-class home and was raised very debt-averse. Through my childhood our house was worth maybe $65,000 and we never really had much. We never needed, but didn't have any surplus. With how frugal I saw my parents being, the thought of me paying $10,000 in realtor fees to sell my home turns my stomach.


We were looking to buy around $300,000. I have a mental block telling me something is wrong with this purchase just because the number is so large. I think about $6,000 to $12,000 in closing costs. In realtor fees of my current house and closing costs of my future house combined I stand to lose $22,000 in fees.


I guess I came here looking for confirmation that what I'm doing is okay and normal and I'm not putting my family's financial future in jeopardy by making the move.

personalfinance,"I've been shopping around for a refinance on a home purchased last year.  I'm one year into my current 30 year loan at a rate of 4.375%.

This is the best of a few offers I've been able to get.  I was able to get this locked in, but my wife and I haven't signed any paper to go through with it yet.  I'm reading through the closing cost worksheet and wondered if my understanding is correct.  I also thought others might benefit from going over these costs together.

Here's my notes and assumptions in the borders of the screen shot.  I'll number the items to make the discussion easier.

Screen shot:  [https://i.postimg.cc/fbrKrYsN/cost-of-loan2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fbrKrYsN/cost-of-loan2.jpg)

Headline numbers:  On the remaining $199k principle balance of my loan, this bank is offering a 15 year 2.75%.  Their percent for a 30 year loan was 3.0%, so I opted for the 15 year loan.  I'm comfortable with the monthly payment.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  The took out the $1629 ""normal"" fee they usually charge.  ok, great.

2.  They list the appraisal fee, but said it was not needed, and took it out the bottom #4.  Kind of strange way of listing that on the closing worksheet, right?  Ok, whatever.

3.  The rest of the $2144 fees are coming mostly from lender's title insurance, settlement/closing cost, state tax/stamps.  Are those things I can negotiate?  Are others getting their lender to paid for those things?  Like...why am I paying for their lender insurance?

4.  see #2 above.

5.  Do I need to scrutinize the prepaid/reserve section?  They're my escrow for property tax and home insurance.  I'm going to have to paid these anyways right?  I'm currently es-crowing with my current loan.  I've never thought much about these since they're things I'd paid anyways.  Do people ever get ripped off on these?  Like the lender collects more money than actually was needed?  Does the daily interest make sense?

If people ever do get ripped off here, I think it would be pretty easy to do.  It's hard to figure out the exact numbers, how many months into the tax year, what's left of the taxes/insurance that hasn't been paid for.

6.  So to get down to determining the real cost of the refinance, is it just the $2144 subtract appraisal fee of $475 = $1669?

personalfinance,"I started grad school this year to get a master's in public health degree. Total tuition costs will be around $55k to 60k (USD).


I have around $48k in savings of which $35k is in a TD Ameritrade account for trading. I have $2.5k in a 403b from my employer which will gain around $50 a week. I'm taking home $650 a week in a fairly secure job in healthcare. (Plus an additional $600 a week in unemployment/work share program until at least the end of July thanks to the recent crisis.)


I don't have regular expenses like rent, utilities, car, etc because my family is incredibly supportive. I pay my credit cards which come to around $300 to $600 a month and some miscellaneous expenses. Bottom line, I should be able to comfortably pay my tuition, pay my 'bills' and maintain healthy savings.


After I graduate, I think I'll gross maybe 80k to 100k. Hopefully more. I'll be 30 in June, 2020. I don't foresee major expenses in the near future unless I decide to buy a house for myself before I'm 40. My credit score is 739.


Recently, a trusted family member has been urging me to take out student loans to pay for grad school. They say there is a good chance student loans will be forgiven so I should make minimum payments until the loans are forgiven. I applied for a federal student loan and was approved for $17k this year and will probably be approved for an additional $40k before I graduate.


The family member also advised I put most of my money into stocks and I can gain enough to cover what I would owe in interest until the loan is forgiven.


I personally don't like the idea of paying interest or putting all my money in stocks. Student loans for grad school accrue 6.5% interest from day 1 and interest gets compounded. Technically, I don't have to pay until I graduate in spring 2023 though my research shows that it's prudent to pay the interest as it accrues during school.

I know.. I should have started taking care of this way earlier than now. However, now I really want to fix it and get back on the trail.

Here are my questions, but please let me know if I need to provide more information, or any other advices are appreciated too.


1. What is the first step I need to take? I found ""Debt Validation Letter"" is not my option, because it has past way more than a month since collections started.

2. How should I approach the ""Auto Loan"" ? (Debt #5). They took away the vehicle, but I see the balance. I believe (from my research on reddit here) it is left over balance after they auctioned the vehicle?

3. Can I still settle the debt with them, and ask for ""pay for delete""?

4. Is it a good idea to make ""Secured Credit Card"" and start utilizing the card (even with minimum amount about $200) while I do the settling?

My SO and I (both in our 30s) are hoping to buy a home in 4-5 years. We are both relatively new in our careers (he's been earning for 4 years and I have for 2 years), and we live in a HCOL area. That is to say, we don't have a ton saved yet.

Now I'm learning towards CDs and bonds, but he still wants to do something like 80% bonds 20% index funds.

I am really only familiar with the Phoenix, Vegas, and Tucson real estate markets, but I've done quite a bit of research looking through listings in these markets trying to find decent cap rates.  They seem to hover around 5%-6% which I believe to be low for the risk you take and managing a rental property after you factor in; bad tenants, occupancy, maintenance, potential evictions etc.  Multi-families at 5% seem to move like hot cakes in these markets.

personalfinance,"Hello, I am currently attending a university and am entering my senior year in August. I have paid the semester off already, and since I transferred from a junior college and have been working since high school, have accumulated no debt throughout. I am living with my significant other, parents, and my son, and plan on doing so until I graduate from school.

My son was born the beginning of this year, and I since the quarantine and baby-bonding played hand-in-hand; I have spent the last four months with him almost (paid) entirely with only a bit of online school to worry about. All of this free time along with having him has motivated me to want to get my master's degree.

Although it would only take an extra year to obtain the degree,, I would undoubtedly be extremely busy with school and work, therefore jeopardizing my time with my child and time I could have been working. I have about $10,000 in savings right now after paying for the next semester, but since I'm a server who relies on tips; I'm sure my earnings will be slashed when I do return to work due to what's currently going on.

I understand this is a personal finance board, but I have two questions.

1. Is taking the extra year and thousands of dollars worth it rather than jumping into my career after receiving my B.S?
2. Is leaving most of the childcare to my significant other while I attend school and work wrong? I feel guilty for doing it, but believe that the whole family would be better off down the line for the short-term sacrifice.",Is getting my master's degree reasonable as a young father?

So basically my girlfriend and I are financially comfortable with stable jobs and no debt. We have an emergency fund covering at least 6 months in rent and expenses. I am am trying to plan our long-term investments. For a while I have been considering investing in real estate. I wasn't sure whether to buy a home for ourselves or rental properties to generate passive income. As our long-term plans are still not clear, I think it makes more sense to build a portfolio of rental properties. That way I am also not necessarily tied to any specific place in case we decide to move. We have both excellent credit scores and ""access"" to NY, GA, FL (primarily thinking about Atlanta and Jacksonville) but I would be open to any region that makes sense.

**My Comp:** 190K Base, 30K+/yr bonus, $60K/yr RSUs, very stable job

**Her Comp:** 150K Base, relatively stable job and could probably find another job easily in the event of a lay off

**Net Worth:** 660K Cash, 138K Investments, 325K Retirement, No Debt, 1 Relatively modern car

**Situation:** We are looking to move forward and hopefully purchase a home in the next 6 or so months.  We got pre approved for $2.3M home price ""conservatively"" on just our base salaries and bonuses.  

My question is - how much should we really be looking to spend on a home?

My quick estimate if we purchase a $2M home we:

* Take home roughly $15,000/month after taxes and retirement (Doesn't adjust for tax breaks)
* Would pay $10,000/month on Mortgage, Taxes, Insurance assuming 20% down, 3.5% interest, 1.125% Property Tax, $11,000/yr insurance
* Leaves \~$5,000/month for Utilities, Food, Childcare and Other

personalfinance,"Hi everybody, I (18f) have been reading on what exactly is a 401(k) and how there is a regular one and a Roth one. Both options are available to me from the coffee shop I work for. 

I've been reading a pdf from them that explains that the Roth one is after-tax contributions which are taxed when contributed, and in the future if I withdraw it, it is tax-free as long as it is in ""qualified distribution."" The regular pre-tax one will be where I'm taxed in the future when I withdraw those funds. This may easily been known to you guys here, but I figured it'd be good for context especially since I'm new to all of this. 

The company I work for will match 100% on the first 5% of my eligible pay. 

In the pdf, it explains that if I choose the 401(k) pre-tax, it can lower the amount of income taxes I pay each period. And, with that extra money, I could contribute it to the 401(k) plan in general. It also allows me to have more disposable income at the time I receive my paychecks. It recommends me to choose this one if I am subject to lower tax rates during my retirement than during the years I contribute to the plan. 

For the Roth 401(k), the pdf explains that my contributions would be deducted during each pay period after my income taxes are taken out. This means my take home pay would be less compared to me making contributions to a 401(k) pre-tax plan. A sentence says, ""Earnings are tax free if they are part of a ""qualified distribution,"" which I don't quite understand. The pdf recommends this option if I am subject to a high tax-rate during my retirement years than the years I contribute to the plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I will be taxed at a higher or lower rate when I retire. I also don't know what affects me to be taxed at a higher rate unless if I make a higher income as I grow older, but doesn't every U.S. citizen get equally taxed according to the tax brackets they meet? I'm still confused on which one I should choose because I want to be sure I make the best decision that suits me. 

In addition, how much should I contribute to the retirements savings I choose? (I will at least do 5% since that is what the company matches.)

For some more background info: I think I can live with less disposable income on a monthly basis because I've developed some savings I can use when I pay my college fees. I'll be pursuing a bachelor's degree starting this fall. I thankfully have all of my tuition covered thanks to a scholarship (as long as I maintain a high GPA), but I still have to pay all other fees such as textbooks, parking, food, etc. The company I work for also offers workers opportunities to invest in their stocks, which I'm still figuring out.

personalfinance,"Hi,
My husband and I are currently saving up for our first home. We’re in our mid 20’s with no kids, both college educated with good careers, no kids (but 2 lovely dogs). We’re currently renting and paying off a car loan before looking into buying a home. I have a strong desire to save up 20% for a home, but I’m a little surprised how much discouragement I’ve gotten from friends and even our financial advisors. 

Out of all our friends, only 1 has put down 20% or more on their home (much older, ~40) and only 1 other friend with home experience (10+ yrs) has said she wished she would’ve waited longer to put down more. The rest of our friends are our age and have put down less than 20% and are very defensive of that choice saying that anything more than 10% doesn’t really get you any advantages in terms of better credit scores, PMI was like $20/mo for them and would fall off when they hit 20% equity, payments weren’t significantly more, and they valued the liquidity in keeping more cash in their bank accounts. 
Now, I try not to pry into other people’s finances as a friend, so these are just the things they’ve offered up when I’ve asked for their advice, but it confuses me as a financial professional. I’ve run some numbers myself, but want to branch out to the community for fresh perspectives. 
My husband and I asked our financial advisors and they didn’t seem to feel very strongly one way or another. I couldn’t tell if it was because they thought we valued buying a home sooner rather than later (in which case we did not have 20% at the time we asked) or if they didn’t expect us to want to wait or what.

It’s reasonable size (1500 sq ft plus a good sized garage in the backyard), has a decent sized yard, and in a safe neighborhood. We have 2 close friends that want to move into the bedrooms upstairs. They would also have the whole loft up there and a bathroom. We were going to charge them $500/month plus utilities/WiFi for $100. One roommate will have a cat and the other wants to buy a dog. This seemed like a good price given the rent price of similar houses in the area ($1500-$2000 approx), maintence, pets, and the use of all the home utilities like laundry.

BUT we made the mistake of telling them our mortgage (yes I know, not the smartest move) One of them confronted us about the two of them talking and thinking that since we make more money than them, 400/month would be more fair since the mortgage is only $1200 (approx anyways since we do not have any interest rates locked)🙄 this is true but 1 of our roommates will be making the same amount as us soonish so it seems kind of sketchy to bring that up. Plus it’s not really their business. We were not basing the rent on our morgatge but all the factors listed above.

personalfinance,"Hey r/personalfinance, 

Sorry if this situation seems to be similar to other posts, but I scoured the internet and it left me with even less confidence in which decision to make. I also know that although we can't completely predict how the market will behave considering coronavirus, I did want some sound advice. 

My parents are both in their early 60's and are planning to retire around 70. They are both not the healthiest individuals, so I think that they will most likely have to retire in their early 70's. They don't have much in terms of savings and do not have a retirement account set up. I thought: Better late than never and wanted to help in some way, so I was thinking of opening a Roth IRA account and having them contribute some of their salary, and I would contribute as well until they hit the 7k limit annually. I am planning to throw it all in the Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund. I know that if my mom were to open her own Roth IRA, we could contribute another 7k, but I'm not sure if we have the funds to do that right now.

Is this a good idea, even if they can't contribute anymore once they retire in about 10 years? Are there other options that I should explore for the same amount annually for the next 10 years (around 7k annually; possibly 14k)? I'm also concerned about the risk involved with investing in the Target Retirement Fund with the COVID situation.

My second was a chase account because they had a promotion that gave me like $400 if I followed some steps. And in the last 4 or 5 months I opened 4 more accounts to be exaxt.

A bank of america because I got a $100 reward I believe

A capital one because I got another $100 reward I believe

A redneck account bc I watched a Graham Stephan video where he said they offer good APY %

And finally a chase business account because I needed a business account and they gave me $300 as long as I deposited $1500.

And I guess I also have another one through EDD Bank of america because of unemployment.

So I have about $3500 in logix (divided evenly between checking and savings)

$2503 in chase business

$1,706 in chase personal checking

$2,869 in advantage plus banking bank of america

$500 in capital one (divided evenly between checking and saving)

$500 in redneck bank

$4500 in EDD UNEMPLOYMENT BoA account

$3000 in acorns which I'm about to take out and transfer

and $500 in my vanguard (which I think I'm about to deposit $5500 to max out previous year)

Just graduated college with little fanfare (go c/o 2020 lmao) and I’m super grateful to have a job lined up at the NIH. However, the pay is not outstanding (just under 32k) and it’s in an expensive area. My rent&amp;utilities is going to be $1150/month, which sounds like a lot but I won’t have a car, I’m walking distance from work, and will have gov’t health insurance. My employer does not facilitate retirement contributions, and there’s a few other nuances of my job being paid via a training award and not a typical salary.

Basically, I’m a complete newbie to personal finance and up to this point I’ve just been doing what my parents have recommended. I have a pretty decent credit score, a couple hundred bucks in Acorns, but otherwise I haven’t done much in terms of handling money. I’m so fortunate to have parents who have told me not to worry about money for most of my life and I’ve never even had a paid job before this, but it’s left me feeling a bit unprepared. I really want to feel more financially independent.

My parents have raised me to stay frugal and I’m not a stranger to budgeting, so I’m relieved and grateful that making ends meet won’t be a serious concern.

However, after this 2 year position, I’m hoping to go to med school (in the US) which isn’t cheap to say the least.

2.  Should I be using a Roth IRA over 401(k)?  My employer does not off any sort of match on my contributions.  From basic research, I should max out the allowed 6k then go back to my employer provided retirement funds?
3.  Currently splitting contributions to traditional 401(k) and roth 401(k), I am seeing a lot of advice stating that I should go 100% roth, as in the long run you would not get taxed on gains as opposed to being taxed on gains vs contributions.

If that's the case, would it be better to just wait until the spring semester when I'm 24 to apply for FAFSA so I can get the status of independent and hopefully get a lot more grant money?

My girlfriend makes 48K a year, she has about 2k of student loan debt that will be paid off in July and then no other debt. She has $830 rent a month, and maybe spends another 300 on discretionary outside of paying off her loan fast.

I have a truck for work with about 10K left on the loan but my company pays me an allowance each month to have it and since buying it I am about 1k ahead from what they pay me.  Essentially I am debt free as long I have this job, which is very secure given my performance in having a direct impact and generating the company revenue.

I currently pay $400 a month in rent to live with a friend and maybe another 200-300 in food and other stuff.  Work gives me $150 for cell and internet so those expenses are dampened.

I am putting 8% of my paycheck into a 401k to maximize match and then another $2400 a month in other ETFs and the max for a IRA (make too much for a Roth but looking into how I can still maybe use it).

This has been leaving me with about 6k a month that I have been saving for a down payment on a house.  Currently I have 60k saved outside of investments.  I want to have at least 6 months expenses saved in an emergency fund so really I have 40k for a down payment that grows 6k a month.

My top end of my budget is 350k for a house (would be about a 3000-3500 sq ft home). In the area I am looking with taxes/insurance it means about a 2K/month payment.

I feel like having 4-5k a month left over gives me a lot of cushion but I could lose customers and that gets tight and I regret my decision.

I office out of home and my girlfriend will work from home 4 days a week likely so the space is important to me but I am wondering with a commissions salary that truly isn’t guaranteed should I be more cautious in what I buy?  I plan to have 20% for a down payment.

Plan to get married within the next 2 years, kids are probably 4 years off. So those are the next bigger events in my life.

TLDR: combined 250k gross income but 150k is commissions, maybe 2-3k in expenses a month at most for next 4 years until kids. is 2k a month mortgage risky?

personalfinance,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I had a tooth pulled back in November at an urgent care dental chain called Immediadent. I don't have insurance so I signed up for a 6-month payment plan. Basically I payed half the total bill upfront, and then put my credit card on file to be automatically charged every month.

I have one final $73 payment remaining, with a due date of today, May 25. I woke up to an e-mail receipt saying NOT APPROVED - card expired. Whoops! Forgot to call them when my card expired last month (4/20).  No biggie, I thought, I'll call and explain the situation.

So I looked them up on Google to get their phone number and according to Google, ALL of their locations have Permanently Closed. I called anyway and got a generic answering machine message about being closed due to covid19. Decided to go to their website and call a different number for their billing department which redirected me to the same message. So, I left a message explaining the situation, and I have no idea if I'll ever get a call back. Even if I do, I feel uncomfortable giving debit card information over the phone to a business that is no longer reputable whatsoever.

Is it likely they'll send a demand notice for payment in the mail? I don't want this to end up collections. My extreme naivety in my early 20's led me to have a pretty shitty credit score and I've been very adamant about building it back up in the last year or so.

TL;DR -- had dental work, filed debit card to make monthly payments. Debit card expired last month, so my final payment (today) didn't go through. Just found out that dental office is now permanently closed. Now I don't know how to pay off my remaining balance and I'm worried about it going to collections.","Making a payment to a business that has permanently closed, expired debit card on file"

personalfinance,"Over the past year or so I've begun saving for an eventual home purchase. I don't have a set timeline, and am still in the wait-and-keep-saving mode, but I've begun some casual window shopping in some areas that I'm interested in.

As a rather handy person, I've been considering the idea of getting a lower cost house, around or below $50,000, which appear to be structurally sound but in need of a lot of cosmetic upgrades. From what I've read, people seem to be fairly commonly in favor of not paying more than the down payment up front for any house due to low mortgage interest rates. But would that same rule still apply when considering such a low cost house, or would people advocate saving to buy outright in cash? The reason a mortgage appeals to me in this scenario is that it could leave more cash available up front to start renovation work sooner after purchase.

However, I've also read that most lenders have a minimum mortgage amount around $50,000+, and that while some local banks might do smaller mortgages, it's fairly uncommon. I'm curious what people's experiences have been with this, and what the likelihood is of finding a place willing to do that.

These areas have roofs, subfloor, and walls/studs but need flooring and drywall to be finished. Because of this, our lender said they they cannot give us a conventional mortgage. 

We looked into a 203k rehab loan, but the monthly payment was $500 more than what we budgeted. Our realtor has suggested looking into it again, because if we finished the house and could do the higher payment for 6 months, after the work is done, the house should appraise for about $150k more than it currently does, which would give us at least another $100k in equity, which would in turn drop our interest rate. 

Since the banks are closed until tomorrow, we're still waiting to see exact numbers, but I want to see if there are any other advisable options for us.

personalfinance,"Sorry if this is confusing, I'm in my early 20s and trying to get my finances all in order. Basically what I want to know is if there's essentially a ""time limit""  from selling off mutual funds *with the intent of re-purposing them* in other investments, before it gets taxed as income I'm receiving for the year. 

So there's two scenarios: One fund I'm not happy with and want to invest in another fund the firm offers instead. I have it worked out where they will deposit the money into my savings and I have 120 days to re-invest in an adjacent fund before they charge me. However, this doesn't affect the tax angle.

The other was some shitty global bond my dad set up that finished at 0% over 10 years (Corona impact notwithstanding). Which is almost impressive in it's ineptitude. I sold that and am expecting a check in the mail for it soon, however I intend on transferring this into my personal Brokerage account with Fidelity (not the same firm).

This is making me shit my pants because I didn't really consider the tax angle on this as I never intended on ""profiting"" the money, so to speak. The mutual fund is a 5 digit lump sum so this would *royally* fuck over my end of year tax income if it counts (it'd essentially be my salary doubled). I can technically cancel this operation but it will nullify all of my paperwork which would suck but whatever.

I have 10k in a 401k that nothing goes into currently.  I have 25k in my current company retirement plan which is a cash balance pension.  I put in 4.5% and they put in 6.75% each month.  I can't increase what I put in, it is forced at that rate.  Then, I have another retirement deal with them that I put in 1k per year and they match that.  Again, that can't be increased on either side.  That's the max match.  Are those decent plans there? 

I pay $1k per month in rent, and my car is paid off.  My after tax income is something like $4200-$4300 range.  

I have a few debts such as $4k left in school loans, $2800 in credit card, $6k in a personal loan from my past.  So I'm working on paying those off as fast as I can first.  

My overall questions are... 

1.  Would it be a good idea to buy a duplex and rent out one side and live in the other?  I don't have 30k saved for a down payment, but I have 850 credit score or around there, so what are the best options for a low down payment type loan?  In my area I can get one for say $225k, and I can easily cover the say $1000-$1300 monthly mortgage even if there is no renter, so to me there is very low risk here.  I'd have a renter hopefully most of the time so they would probably be paying the vast majority of the mortgage... To me that's rent free living, and no car or house payment means I can really stack up cash and save at least $2k per month or maybe more.  I understand all the pitfalls and have read them in previous posts on this sub and others, and I feel like especially if I use a rental agency place to field the calls from tenant and hire out any work then it would be fine.  But what do you guys think?
2. Should I start putting in say $100 each month into my old 401k which sits idle?  I did make a new roth ira alongside it, and maybe I should put that money into it instead, or combine them somehow?  My income will go up each year until I hit say $100k which is probably in 4 years, and then after that I will only get 2% raise forever.  
3. Even with my pension and side $2k per month pension deal and my existing 401k.. With online calculators if I do the math out to 20 years (id like to retire at 55 if possible, but seems not) then I'd really ""only"" end up with like 400-500k if that.  That doesn't seem like enough to retire on.  I do have the option to take a lifetime annuity figured up against the cash balance of my main retirement plan if I choose, but then all my other stuff has to make up the difference and somehow pay for health insurance.  

So overall, I'm single, no wife no kids.  I want to just work towards being financially free and have a passive income to where eventually I don't need to work until 65.  My income and living in a lower cost area to me should help me do this, but the only thing I can find that gives you real monthly passive income very easily is the duplex idea with rent.

This situation is still rather fresh, but I wanted to share my perspective for anyone else in my shoes or who happens to know someone in my shoes.  This is very much a story about relationships, but I'm sharing here because I would often frequent personal finance communities when trying to find a way to dig myself out without having to come clean.  
  
**TL;DR: Over the course of three years, I ran up a total of $25k in secret credit card debts.  1.5 years ago my balance was up to $13k and my dad took out a secret loan in his name to consolidate $11k of it.  Since then I've built up the accounts back up to $16k.  Came clean to wife a few weeks ago.  Present day formerly-secret debt: $24k.  Wife and I working through it.**  
  
**The Financial Situation**  
$72k single-income household, $17k student loans (mine), $4k car loan (mine), $16k in secret credit card debt, $8k secret loan that my dad took out for me to consolidate secret credit card debt 1.5 years ago.  
   
**The Story**  
I'm now learning how truly awful my inability to communicate about uncomfortable personal matters has been for pretty much my entire life.  This has led me to make poor decisions in an attempt to ""manage"" situations and others' emotions, rather than to face them head on out of fear of disappointing those close to me.  The main victim in this story is my wife of 5 years.  To try and sum it up, the anxiety I experience at the potential of disappointing someone most directly affected my ability to talk about money with my wife.  Early in our relationship/marriage my job was our primary income, but we were both working.  Then when we decided to start a family we agreed to go down to just my income for the foreseeable future.  Started at $45k/year when we had one kid (3.5 years ago), has grown to $72k/year present day with two kids.  I'll lay out more numbers here shortly, but this was a very typical and sustainable situation for many families.  I have a very stable job (civil engineering) and we live in a rural Low-Cost-of-Living area, which is a great formula.  When making these decisions though I don't think either of us truly grasped how dysfunctional my anxiety really was, and how it would lead to a breakdown in critical communication.
  
Until this past week we had separate checking accounts, with one joint account to park our tax refunds.  Instead of saying ""I need help with this"" or ""We may need to save up to buy that"" I would just say ""Yeah, we can get that"" or ""I've got it covered.""  There weren't any major purchases happening, it was just never setting or maintaining an appropriate limit on ever day expenses.  When my income wasn't backing up what I was saying, I started to turn to credit cards.  The first two credit cards weren't a secret, she knew I had them, but she didn't know that I had stopped paying them off each month.  As these early balances started to grow my inability to cope started to show up as well.  I started to turn to secret eating, funded primarily by the secret credit cards.  My secret meals would mostly be on weekdays when on my way to work or during lunch.  $5 Fast Food Breakfast, then a $5-10 Fast Food Lunch.  Sometimes when running errands I'd grab a $3-4 Fast Food Snack.  ""Nothing too wild.""  ""I've got it covered.""  As I got close to maxing these cards out, I started applying for more cards.  About a year and a half ago, my secret credit card balances were up to around $13k.  97-99% utilization.  The only person I was talking to about this was my dad.  My credit score was shot, right around 600.  When I started really feeling the heat my dad offered to take out a loan in his name to consolidate my credit card debt.  I didn't tell my wife and he didn't tell my mom (his wife).  Within a couple of weeks I had $11k of my $13k ""paid off.""  I only had to pay a $60/month minimum on my remaining Chase Slate balance, and send a $200 check to my dad each month to pay towards the loan.
  
Yeah.  You're seeing where this is going.  Not only because I already spoiled the ending, but it's obvious that my issues weren't resolved.  Cold turkey doesn't work for everyone, especially when the problem wasn't really solved, it just had a lower interest rate for the time being.  
  
A little over a year after the consolidation loan (bringing us up to last fall), I had those credit card balances back to the max.  Accelerated by a few grand in medical debt we were paying off, then more medical costs related to the addition of a second child (who just turned 1 this month).  The only thing that really kept this cover up alive was all of the distractions with a highly complicated pregnancy.  I started to really start feeling the heat again late last summer, but then my annual raise came through in a big way.  Instead of 3-4% typical, I landed 8%.  Which was enough to help me maintain minimum payments on 7 maxed credit cards (topping off at $16k), sending that $200/month to my dad, and pay $300/month on payment plans we set up with the hospital.  
  
Over the last few months my anxiety really started to spike as the reality of the situation started setting in.  I wasn't going to be able to fix this on my own.  I was actively lying to the person I loved the most, and started to see how it was going to affect our children's lives.  They didn't deserve a father who was checked out all of the time trying to figure out a secret financial fiasco.  A father who's weight was fluctuating from 210-250 in an endless cycle each year (I'm 6'0"" for reference).
  
Three weeks ago, my wife saw some fast food trash I'd left in my car.  This started a real conversation.  We'd talked about this issue in the past, so she could tell there was something else going on.  I was busted.  I came clean about the $16k in active credit card debt.  A week later I finally came clean about the loan my dad had taken out for me.  
  
A few days after I came clean about everything my relationship with my wife actually started feeling better than it has in years.  We're actually communicating about everything.  We're working through things together.  Of course there are many other aspects of our relationship that would be impossible to add here without it being a mega-post and totally off-topic of personal finance.  Just wanted to share this story from my perspective for anyone hanging out here who might be in the middle of a similar situation.  She is still processing a lot, we still have a pile of debt to knock out, but we're doing things fully as a team again.  
  
Her parents feel betrayed, and scared for what this could mean for their daughter and grandkids if I don't seek to fix my personal issues.  They've also been very supportive over the years.  Her dad has taught me a ton of handy-man type skills.  A few months ago our water heater busted, he offered to split the cost of a new one and them taught me how to install it.  They've bought us a couple of couches, an oven, a dishwasher, he's built us furniture for the kids.  The only sizeable portion of money in a savings account for the kids' future is a few grand that he put towards it.  I have a great relationship with them, and we will be talking face to face about this soon to try and clear the air.  Meanwhile, my parents are trying their best to play this off as if I don't need to be held accountable and this if somehow my wife's fault, also haven't once acknowledged the affect this type of secrecy and dysfunction could have on the kids.
  
I've started seeing a therapist to work on my anxiety, shame, coping skills, and communication.   
  
**The Numbers**  

**Annual Gross Income: $72,000**  
**4-Week Net Income: $4,400** (after health insurance and life insurance premiums, 0% to retirement at the moment)  
I get paid every 2 weeks, since we are paycheck-to-paycheck we just use this for our monthly income and treat the extra check in Jan and July as ""bonuses.""  

*Mortgage: $1,210  
*Electric: $175  
*Water: $50  
*Sewer: $50  
*Internet: $45  
*Streaming Services: $40 (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, Prime)  
  
*Car Payment: $146 (Her car is paid for, I owe $4,100 on my vehicle, which is actually in her name... another layer to the story)  
*Car Insurance: $75  
*Fuel: $100  
  
*Chase CC #1: $35  ($940 balance, 22.99%, closed)  
*Chase CC #2: $52  ($2,270 balance, 12%, closed)  
*Chase CC #3: $55  ($2,390 balance, 12%, closed)  
*Chase CC #4: $16  ($700 balance, 12%, closed)  
*Discover CC: $175  ($8,700 balance, 19.99%... the prize hog, open)  
*CapitalOne CC: $25  ($700 balance, 24.75%, open)  
*Synchrony Amazon Prime CC: $35 ($300 balance, 25.99%, open)  
*Payment to Dad: $200
  
**Remaining income after above expenses: $1,916**  

These are the areas we will be really cutting into soon.  
*Groceries: $800  (Primarily organic, split between Kroger, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods)
*Kid-Related (Diapers, etc): $200  
*Other Household Supplies:  $300
*Restaurant Meals:  $600  (yikes...)
  
These are just averages, but typically one of the fields would fluctuate to eat up any remaining amount frostands m each paycheck.  Until recently my Chase CC payments were higher as well.  The three cards listed at 12% are on a negotiated payment plan now.  All 4 Chase CC accounts have been closed, just paying them off now.  Will be exploring options with Discover CC in near future.  
  
I usually am able to earn $100-$200/month in OT pay, which I will be heavily pursuing in near future and trying to boost that number.  Annual raises are announced in June, should be at least 3-4%.  Also looking to start a side gig this summer.  I'm pursuing a drone license and will try and make some money with it.  Will open up some extra OT at work for certain work we are doing, and will try and get some side-gigs for simple photo/video work in area.  Already have a DJI Mavic Mini (which is enough to get started in my area, at least to start getting established and earn towards more professional drone).  Got the drone used by selling a couple of old-hobby related items I'd held on to.   
  
**Moving Forward**  
Will be sitting down with my wife in next couple of days for our first real budget meeting.  We had signed up for the 14 Day Trial for Financial Peace University and watched the first two lessons.  Not sure how my wife feels about the Dave Ramsey Baby Steps, but I also know she is processing a ton of information and feelings right now that I've had a 3 year head start on.  I won't be pushing to hard.  Just going to be going over what the actual situation is, start lining up what our goals as a family are (short term and long term), and then working towards building a budget that will help us reach those goals.  
  
Main purpose of this post was just to share.  I'm open to all comments/input/suggestions/discussion though!

Given that, you could take from another account and pay yourself whatever dollar amount you have the means to, every couple weeks or every month, and then just have one or several outgoing transfers going back to that original account, in other words recirculating the same money to yourself and back again each month and raising your income to whatever.

personalfinance,"Hi. I'm aware this is likely a dumb question, but I don't have many people I can ask this kind of thing of.

For the most part, I'm following the flowchart with my finances. I'm 33, debt free (including car and student loans, but I rent so no mortgage yet, or possibly ever), have +3 months in a high yield savings account for emergency savings, and contribute about 25% of my income towards my employer's 403b and Roth.

Thank you Reddit Money think-tank. You folks are inspiring. 3 years ago we were living month to month and didn't even have an emergency fund.",Need some advice on my first ever refinance request.
personalfinance,"Some background:

Bought my starter home \~6 years ago for $350,000 on a 30 Year Term at 3.875% in a fairly high COL area. I have PMI, but it's only $50/month.

Home has appreciated a significant chunk, over $100,000.

Ideally I could keep my starter home, and use it as a rental.

My ultimate goal is to buy land and build a forever home. 

I am fortunate enough to have family support to provide significant assistance with a down payment on the eventual land purchase and/or construction loan.

&amp;#x200B;

With rates being so low, I can likely refinance down to 3.0% and maybe more if I pay for points.

The benefits of this I see are:

	1) Removing my PMI

	2) Lowering my overall interest over the life of the loan

	3) Lowering my monthly payment

The downsides seem to be:

	1) Restarting my term from 24 years to 30 years

	2) The closing costs of refinancing

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the advice I see is to make sure you don't sell too soon to negate any gains I would get from refinancing. However, my plan is to hold onto this property for the very long term so I don't believe that applies.

Additionally, with my goal of taking out another loan, it would seem to me that lowering my monthly payment would allow for a larger loan due to more capacity in my debt to income ratio. 

Lastly, paying as many points down as possible also seems like the right move to lower that monthly payment as much as possible. I would likely roll the closing costs into the new loan to avoid having to pay anything upfront as I'd like to retain as such cash as possible for the eventual construction loan.

With those considerations, I've started shopping around and plan to find the best combination of lowest rate and resulting monthly payments that I can.

personalfinance,"I have a 2012 Honda Civic with 80k miles on it. It needs a new engine, it ran too hot and has a blown head gasket, I was told the engine is a total loss. Additionally, given my poor financial situation, it's been sitting idle in my friend's driveway for over six months as I haven't been able to afford to do anything with it.

I was quoted $3000+ for parts and labor to replace the motor. Additionally, from what I can gather, given that the car has been sitting for so long, there are likely a myriad of additional issues that would need addressing. I've gathered from some research that I could reasonably expect to need to replace:

* Motor
* Brakes
* Battery
* Belts
* Filters
* Tires

And anything else that comes up in a diagnostic, as with the car not running there could be other problems that arise as repairs are made.

In my furloughed status due to COVID, I've saved $2000 of my unemployment money so far. My roommate has generously offered to match that if need be toward purchasing a used car or making repairs to my current one.

My questions: 

1. Given the age, mileage, and state of my car, and the fact that I can't reasonably be sure how much repairs could end up costing on my Civic, should I go ahead with repairs, or buy a used car to replace it? (I'd have to tow the car from shop to shop to get more repair quotes)

2. Would my car even have any trade-in value to a dealership? Or scrap value?

My credit is awful, and I absolutely cannot afford any serious monthly payment on a new or used vehicle. I could either pay cash up front for repairs or a different vehicle, or finance a used car for the amount that I have on hand to make payments, but I'd be terrified to take on any long-term payments of any serious amount.

What do I do? I'm so nervous about making the wrong decision.

This part of me wants to wait until my 3 month forbearance ends and go with a deferral option which Quicken doesn't offer but according to the govt. my Freddie May loan qualifies for a deferral.

So here are my options. Keep in mind I already put myself into this forbearance situation.

The forbearance ends on 6/30.

\#Option 1 - Pay off the three months now in a lump sum and extend the forbearance by another three months. This will end the threatening letters and still allow me to extend my forbearance period which assures me safety in case things get WAY worse, which they can. I hope they get better though. This option wouldn't financially strain me at all, at the moment. I understand that on 7/1 mortgage services are required to allow deferrals, so in theory if I was on forbearance from 7/1 - 9/30 I could defer this part. As of now Federal unemployment ends on 7/31 so this works.

\#Option 2 - I keep receiving PAST due notices along with forbearance notices and wait for Quickenloans to contact me in mid June with the choices that are available to me. Lump Sum or Loan Modification, Maybe a deferral (unsure as this isn't available until 7/1)? I really don't like the fact that when I call they are so sweet and nice on the phone and even reassuring, but then when I receive my bill or even check the mail I am threatened with a dink on the credit score, a foreclosure, etc.... With this option I believe I could extend the forbearance by another 3 months and either defer or pay off the initial three months.

\#Option 3 - I pay off the 3 months now in a lump sum and end the forbearance when Quickenloans contact me. I am hesitant to do this because I'm not sure if I can go back once I go off... Also it's already on my credit report so whatever long term horrific effect this will have on me is already done. I don't prefer this option given the employment landscape in my industry (LIVE EVENTS, think like Detroit Auto Show)...

I am looking for some real advice here and trying to get some perspective from experience people. This is my first home and I am pretty young.

Update 1: My mortgage is Freddie Mac

Update 2: On all three credit reports, it currently shows ""Deferment"" in the notes column. So there is no mention of forbearance on my credit report. wow.",Mortgage Forbearance Advice Needed

I’m looking for some advice! My grandmother (F 85) recently came to me asking for help finding a fiduciary to help her manage her money. I work in an adjacent space and I want to make sure I’m giving her sound advice. 

Up until now, she’s been working with a stockbroker and has been picking her own investments, but wants someone to more actively manage her money given recent events. She draws an income from her pension and social security (US-based), but wants to ensure that the money is in good hands.  She is against putting it in a trust (I’m not entirely sure why) and doesn’t want to put it into a passively managed fund (something like a Vanguard). She’s looking for someone to balance her portfolio dynamically to help regain some of the lost value. She has enough to make the balance requirements to seek out this type of arrangement.

What I’ve told her so far is that there isn’t going to be a simple answer and a lot of picking the right person is whether you like them and they understand your goals. I told her we should set up some interviews with prospective fiduciaries where we’d ask a series of questions. We’re talking later this week and I’d like to get some of your thoughts before going back. So far, I have:

*  **Introduction**
   * Clearly state your financial goals and time horizon
   * Articulate what you want to get out of the arrangement
* **Questions**
   * Can you talk about experiences managing others’ investments who have similar goals and time horizon to mine?
   * Do you have any preliminary thoughts about how you might help me achieve my goals?
   * How does your fee structure work?

And then, how should we go about searching out a fiduciary? I was doing some reading and it said to go out to NAPFA, but any other guidance would be appreciated!

personalfinance,"I (22/M) started a new job in the software industry ($80K/year) a few weeks ago. I have about $5.1k of debt between two federal subsidized student loans. I do not have to begin payment on them until December 2020. Once the grace period is over, interest will be 5.05% on one and 4.45% on the second.

In terms of existing investments, I don't have any unfortunately and I currently have $1.5k in savings.

My company doesn't offer a 401k but does contribute $500 annually towards an HSA. With that, my current plan is to max out my HSA, putting in $3050 ($254/month) for 2020.  Additionally I plan to set aside $17100 ($1450/month) for my 401k and $6k ($500/month) to max out my Roth IRA.

With that plan, after my living expenses, leaves me about out $400 a month to start increasing my savings and $300 to start paying off my student loans.

The flowchart suggests that I take care of my debt first, but considering the relatively small size of my debt and that I'm at a company with high job security (they are actually aiming to increase the head count in my department substantially during this economic downturn), I thought it would be a good idea to just go ahead and start saving for retirement.

Would I be better off contributing less towards my retirement and pay off my student loans faster, possibly before the grace period even ends? Are the interest rates on my loans high enough to justify that?

personalfinance,"My husband and I got into a BAD car loan two years ago. I mean like $8000 loaned on a car that was probably only worth $3000, and a 22% interest rate. It had 140,000 miles, but we were desperate for a car, and our credit was bad (honestly abysmal is more of a correct term). We had a newborn and were desperately trying to limp back home after I graduated from law school. All we knew then was that this was the only thing we could get and we needed to get back home. 

Now we're beginning to pay for it in other ways. The car is valued somewhere between $1000 and $2000 depending on which tool you use. It has 170,000 miles on it, and going into summer our A.C. wasn't working. We have improved our finances immensely, so our budget allowed an A.C. recharge. We got it recharged and everything was working great. That lasted about 24 hours. We took it back into the shop and they said that the rear compressor (it is a Ford Expedition) was leaking. We were quoted between $650-$1680 depending if we did everything needed and included warranties. In addition to that problem, the car burns oil like crazy. We have to refill it about every 1000 miles. 

My point of view is that paying, give or take, $1000 to put into the car would be a waste. Our payoff amount today is right above $5000. If we keep the loan and pay it off we will pay a total of  $8000 over the next two years. I honestly do not believe the car will last the remaining 2 years of the loan, or 100,000 miles whichever comes first. 

Our credit scores have gone from atrocious to holding at 710 on Transunion, Equifax, and Experion. I'm of the opinion that I would rather roll that $2000-3000 (depending on factors) into a reasonable car loan with a 5% interest rate instead of paying a 22% interest rate on a car that will most likely die within the next year. I know we will need to tires before winter as these won't be safe come November. I just see it as a money pit for us. My husband has no qualms about this as he would rather drive our 2 year old around in something that 1. Has A.C. and 2. He isn't worried about the reliability.

I've been tracking all my expenses since 2008. After I moved to the US, it became much easier, because credit cards are prevalent. Cash is rarely used. Usually cash is the problem for tracking, because you have to log it manually. 

I still use cash sometimes, mainly during traveling. So I was looking for a good app to track that.

**Requirements**:

1. iOS.
2. Easy transaction entry on the go.
3. Support multiple currencies with flexible conversion. This means that I should be able to enter exactly how much I exchanged (without automatically setting the exchange rate).
4. Export to CSV. I use the mobile app only for capturing expenses. Then I regularly export it to my primary system (currently it's plain-text accounting in beancount).
5. Support multiple accounts (e.g. I have ""cash usd"", ""cash &lt;other currency&gt;"").
6. Custom categories.

NB: afaik, all widely used apps (Mint, YNAB, etc.) don't support multiple currencies and easy transaction entry on the go. I needed something specific for this purpose.

When I used Android, I really liked [Financisto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.orangesoftware.financisto&amp;hl=en_US). But I couldn't find anything good on iOS.

Until recently. **I've found a great app called** [**Debit &amp; Credit**](https://debitandcredit.app/).

personalfinance,"Canadian here.

I found out in 2016 that my dad had given me the wrong Social Insurance Number. I found out because the Carbon Tax started and I got a letter from the government about it that had a different SIN than I used but my name and everything. Previously, the CRA had sent a letter my previous employer about my information not matching but my employer misspelled my name so we thought that was it (I left that job before I found out). So the letter made sense. 

Well, by then I had a credit card and a small car loan (I was 20) and I had just started at another job so I just gave my new employer my SIN and started doing my taxes with that SIN. It looks like the CRA caught the mistake because my taxes from 2013 - 2016 are not missing. 

Anyways, the problem is I am legit scared to deal with this, so I put it off because I have unreal anxiety. The real problem is the loan and credit card. One time I went to check out a new car at a dealership to trade in my vehicle and when they ran my SIN they said there were no loans on file. That's when I realized this was going to be a little difficult. So I put this of until now, I'm 23 now. But I'm forcing myself to deal with it. 

I tried contacting the credit card company but they were no help. They gave me the number of one of the workers at my local branch (credit card is through my bank). I haven't called this number yet because I am at a loss of who to deal with. 

My questions:

Do I call the credit bureaus first? Or talk to my branch? Can credit be retroactively given to the new SIN??

personalfinance,"Hi everyone, I'm graduating this month with a bachelor's in a growing STEM field and I've accepted a PhD program offer in the same field. I've been working part-time for the past 3 years and living with my parents, so with my spending habits I've been able to save up a decent amount. This new school is about a 3 hour drive from where I am living now. The PhD will take probably around 5 years to earn, and at this point I plan on moving back to my current area afterwards. 

My taxable stipend is a little over $23,000 for the academic year, but it becomes over $31,000 if I can secure a position at the university during the summer. I've tried to do my math assuming I won't be working summers, but I would almost certainly end up at the school, internship, or a temporary/part-time job during summer anyways. My contract with the school is valid for 4 years, but after that schools will typically still provide a stipend to PhD students that are still performing, since it looks back for admissions when there are unfunded students. 

When I'm ready to buy, I'm on track to have around $18K-$19K saved in cash assets. I own a reliable vehicle with no loan. I lived at my undergrad school for 1 year and have only about $7K in student loans that my parents are planning on paying (I'd have no issue if I end up paying these, but I appreciate the gift). I have a few credit cards with no carried over balances, and my credit score with all 3 bureaus is around 750 based on CK and Chase (not FICO). I could likely get a cosigner if it were necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Buy option**: Houses I am looking at run from $70K-$85K. With 20% down, the monthly payment would be $650-$740 (20-year mortgage) or $600-$650 with a 30-year, tax and insurance included. I am pretty handy and have friends I could call for advice on maintenance for the house. Also, most of these houses are 2-3 bedroom and I could probably rent one to another student for around $500-$600 a month. Based on my current plan, I'd sell the home and use the money for a down payment once I graduate, but it may also be an option to keep it as rental income.  

**Rent**: I would rent for around $550-$600 a month (+ utilities), which looks to be the going rate in the area. I'd put most of my savings into investments with around a 6% expected return. Based on the plan, I'd then use that money to buy a house here.

&amp;#x200B;

According to [smartasset.com](https://smartasset.com)'s calculator, buying would become better than renting at around 4-5 years in (ignoring income from renting to a roommate). Of course, there are other factors to keep in mind like unexpected repairs and differences in utility prices. Also, renting would give me more flexibility if anything changed with my PhD program. However, I also really appreciate living in my own home and being able to do things like work on my car in the driveway without worrying much about a landlord. In my mind, I'd just be buying an investment property that I can improve for \~5 years until I'm ready to sell.

Does anyone have any thoughts on what I should do? I know I've posted a lot of info here. Any feedback at all would be greatly appreciated!",Incoming STEM PhD Student: Buy or Rent a Home?
personalfinance,"Hello, I have reduced debts to only the mortgage; car, student loans, HVAC loan, credit settlement are all completely paid for a few months or more. 

I have been using windfalls to create a subsidy for paying credit cards, to the tune of $700 monthly. That is enough to offset a large amount of my monthly paying credit, but some still come from my paycheck-to-paycheck budget. 

Yes, I have a budget and guide the household spending by the budget. It's not perfect every month, but it's very close. The pattern of spending is predictable, but it is not exactly conforming to forecasts.

There are two credit cards remaining open for use. One pays gas and car maintenance, and recently began at six month healthcare payment plan. Two parts for groceries and dining, but also covers clothing, grooming, and leisure purchases. Both are paid in the amount spent, plus; in April balances hit zero and bounced up a little! It made for a pair of months without interest accrual. So April balances were $33 and $17, respectively. May balances are $353 and $577, respectively. I have payments scheduled already to pay the amount spent, which is higher than the current statement balance. 

So, I feel it's under good control and want to improve my structure. 

Two ideas that I've been thinking: 
A) pre-purchase gift cards (with the next windfall) from the grocery store we typically shop to avoid buying groceries on credit card or reduce how much gets shopped on credit card.
B) pre-purchase gift card (with the next windfall) for car maintenance from the shop we typically take the car to avoid placing car maintenance on the card.

I look forward to the healthcare payment to be complete, but I am comfortable with the process. I do not want to jump the gun by paying that faster when the next windfall comes. 

There are several things I think could be pre-paid with the next windfall to avoid spending on credit, so that idea is favorable. 

*Question* what else would you consider to move routine or typical spending of credit cards? How would it be paid instead?

Would you consider more spending on credit for the rewards so long as you know it gets paid? For ex, the utilities get paid! Using the card would earn rewards, and the amount typically spent will get paid to credit account instead of directly to utility account.

Other other notes: household budget is average $78k in/out annually, grocery line averages $540 monthly, gas averages $55 monthly, dining averages $160 monthly, car maintenance averages $390 quarterly, all entertainment/leisure averages $240 monthly, all utilities averages $340 monthly.

About a month ago I received a line of credit through a well known lender. Not a huge amount, less than $2,500. I used the total amount on the card along with a cash payment on one purchase. 

Last week I was going to make my first payment. I signed in online, and it says payment due $0. It says amount available to spend $0. But it said my next statement would be available in a few days. 

Said statement arrived, and now it says $0 due by a certain date. I check credit karma and it says I have 0% usage on the card. But the lender still says I have $0 available to spend and it doesn't show any purchases.

I'm not an idiot, obviously there was some type of accounting error not on my side. So I guess my question is what can happen if I just let this ride? I got the credit line just to build credit, which it has done for me already. But I'm worried that if they catch their mistake somewhere down the road they will tack on the 20 some odd percent interest, as we had an agreement it would be interest free if every payment was on time. Although if every payment is 0$ then I am still making them on time correct?","Received a store credit card, maxed it in one purchase, statement does not reflect"

TLDR: Leaving NYC for about a year and need a car for that time period, what is the most financially responsible way of going about that.

My wife and I are were each told that although our jobs are secure, we will be working from home until at least 2021.

personalfinance,"My dream is to be certified as a tax accountant in Japan and have my own business to help foreigners who would like to open businesses in Japan.

There must be many people who want to move to Japan but are unable to do so due to the language barrier and local regulation.

But that dream has put on hold because of the worst and terrifying experience while I was living in a country in South East Asia.

I got scammed by loan sharks - illegal moneylenders. 


I moved to this country one year and half years ago for my career. I was also studying to be a certified accountant.


And I needed a loan for tuitions. The bank couldn’t lend me because I was still new to the country.


And I found the website for a loan institution. I have provided my phone number and they have called me. I applied for a loan, and instantly approved. I was skeptical. After hearing the loan term. It was shocked that the interest rate is more than 30% in a weekly rate (not annual rate).


I refused and requested for the cancellation. They yelled at me. I was terrified. Then, they demanded a cancellation fee of doubled loan amount. I kept refusing to pay. But they harassed me by telling me to reveal all my personal information and the fact that I borrowed money illegally to my company and on the internet.

I did not know what to do but took a weekly loan. This was their strategy.

A week later, I paid off by paying the sky-rock interest. Then they started sending me money without my loan agreement. From that point, I was trapped. For the last 10 months or so, I suffered from their harassment and debt has increased to around approx. USD20,000, which started with that first loan USD2000.

I have been mentally depressed since then and became suicidal since April 2020. I could not confess this to my family, friend, and company because I was very ashamed of myself.

And I no longer be able to pay the illegal lenders. The harassment has escalated. I attempted the suicide for a couple times. But of course I couldn’t. I am a weak person.

On May 10th, 2020, My choice was to kill myself or ask for help.


At this moment, I hadn’t have a good sleep for a month, and I couldn’t eat at all. Due to Covid-19, I was stuck in my room. And I was just staring outside all day.

But somehow, I was writing to my friends and family in Japan for help. They bought an airplane ticket for me right away, and I escaped from the country next day.

I am back in Japan but still very much depressed. Sometimes I still think about disappearing.

however, I try to think positive. I still want to achieve my dream. 


Due to the illegal lenders, my personal debt has increased because I was paying them using my credit cards and savings etc. 

now I am back home in Japan. I want the second chance to restart my life from scratch, and work hard toward my dream.


I would like to ask you for favor for me to have therapist and recover also from the debt.


Thank you so much,

personalfinance,"I leased a 2019 Ford Escape LE through a Ford dealership last year with Ford credit. I pay $450 a month, and it’s a 3 year, 12,000 mile a year lease. I had really terrible credit and needed a vehicle so this is what I got. The plan was to just restart with a better vehicle in 3 years. 

However I love this car. It serves every need I have and then some, it’s nice, it’s comfortable, makes great MPG, has every feature I want, and I’ve grown really attached to it. I’ve also gone way over miles already. I’m at 18,500 after a year so it’ll be pricey at the end of the lease anyway. 

I looked up my buyout cost and in my lease agreement it says I can purchase the car for $14,000. That’s not a bad price at all, and ideally I’d like to save that much and buy the car outright (as opposed to another loan) so I don’t have to make payments anymore.

personalfinance,"IF you have a very high amount of student loans and IF your expected salary for your field is below a certain level and IF you don't expect to pay these loans off for say, 20 years (or longer), THEN you may be better off doing an Income Driven Repayment plan, contributing towards an IRA or 401K instead of putting all your disposable income into paying off the loans, having your balance forgiven in 20 years, and taking the tax burden at the end of that period. 

Why? Let's say you're 30 years old, graduate from a masters degree, and don't expect to pay it off until you're 50. You also don't have anything in retirement. Which is better, being 50 years old with $0 to your name because you finally paid off all your student loans, or being 50 years old with 20 years of compounding retirement savings and bearing the tax burden of the forgiven amount?

personalfinance,"First of all, I am a sub landlord and I pay 1000 a month to live here and I feel very comfortable and no difference than owning it also not worry about fixing anything or basic maintenance like tree trimming or replacing the roof. I know there is risk being sub landlord, but because of the area and I am pretty good at handle this, I have never had any issue. So we are not comparing life differences here.

That said, if today, I am going to buy the same house that I live in value at 773k today. Here is the break down number in year 2027: (84 months later)

Down payment: 156k,
Total payments: 228k (95k equity, 134k interest)
Property tax: 9k a year, 63k over 7 years.
Insurance: 260/mo, 22k over 7 years.
Home repair and basic maintenance and roofing, appliances replacement, etc: 2k a year, 14k over 7 years. 

Grand total that paid over the 7 years is 327k (3900 per month) and only 95k went to equity, in other words, 230k were dump to drain in terms of investment.

However, if I were to continue renting the house for the next 7 years, and pay $1000 and gradually increase to 1200 a month, my total rent will be about 92k and that’s it.  Meanwhile, I have 156k saved from down payment plus saved 2900 (3900-1000) a month and I put them in a pretty conservative investment plan and yield 4% over 7 years. I will have 485k in cash at the end of 7 years, then minus 92k for rent, that’s 393k. Then minus down payment of 156k, that’s 237k which is capital gain. 

So, at the end of the 7 years, I would have “made” 237k from “saving” the money. If the value of the house when I sell it is more than 237k over the value when I buy it, then buying is better, otherwise, renting is better. 

Of course I simplified the calculation, for example the risk of stock market, and the mortgage interest tax deduction. 

TLDR: My question is that if I can rent the same house for just 1000/mo instead of paying 3900/mo normally for all the payment of buying the house, will it make sense financially to rent?",Is there some cases that renting might be better than buying a house?

personalfinance,"I have not been very hands on with the trust. I finished graduate school last year and started drawing $2500/month from it in July.

Current spread: 2.4% cash,  31% fixed income, 62% equities, 4% tactical and opportunistic. I'm still not working, but working very hard to find employment.

I set up a phone call with my trustee this week. I'm not sure how to approach this relationship. He usually discusses things in a way that implies him and I working together, but there is a board that needs to approve decisions. I gave him a budget last year for my disbursements that showed normal expenses like rent, etc, but he knew I was traveling at the time (nothing extravagant, and there has always been a possibility of me working overseas). That made me feel like I can trust him. He was chosen by my late grandparents, the grantors of the trust.

On one hand, I feel like I should be as transparent as possible with him. I have accumulated $17,000, mostly from the trust stipends. My foreign partner and I have decided to pursue a fiancee visa, which will cost about $6000. Employment is rather elusive right now, though I'm confident in my skills, developing more knowledge, expanding my network, and applying where appropriate for my field of interest.

On the other, I know he works for a company that makes money by managing the trust. I'd like to know more about the trust and finance in general to be a good steward of those assets. Is my trustee a solid source for this? Should I be wary of advice that may be targeted towards keeping those assets with his company?

What if I were interested in pursuing an investment opportunity in the future that requires pulling money out? Could I expect him to push back on that idea for his own benefit?

It would be really nice to have a knowledgeable ally who's advice I can trust. But I don't know the guy. Might be worth mentioning that Art manages assets for my parents as well.

Someone the next state over spent $310.45 at a Home Depot in a city I’ve never been in. This person spending this amount set my account at $51 exactly, so it didn’t notify me of a low balance.

A couple of weeks ago I had a weird login attempt on my main email account from Germany (I know people use VPNs) and it said they used my password. I changed my password (and yes I changed my passwords to my bank and email again). I also had a charge on my bank a few weeks ago for Thrive Market (and I don’t have a membership) and when I contacted them to reverse it, they said I didn’t have a membership under the email I provided. Then they investigated and saw that the charge came from an old email of mine I don’t use anymore for anything and reversed the charge for me. I’m positive I personally never signed up for thrive on this email, and never signed up for a paid subscription. I got refunded the money back to my account. But how did this account I was entirely unaware of, have my bank information, and signed up for a membership. 

Lastly, I tried to login to my PayPal and venmo accounts (I no longer use), and the accounts are locked. I tried to reset the passwords but I always come up with an error message on PayPal or I don’t receive the email from venmo to reset the password.

I have about $20,000 in my bank accounts, $3,000 in ACORNS (which I think I'm going to take out and put somewhere else), and the $500 in vanguard.

So my question is should I invest in a roth ira or solo 401k. This past year I made about $15,000 being self employed but I anticipate I will make a lot more money this year. Maybe anywhere from $50,000-$100,000 (hard to gage exactly as I'm a personal trainer) and so on. I've seen people say if you're in a lower tax bracket now and will make more money later, do a roth ira. If you make more money now and anticipate you will make less in the future, do 401k. But I also see some say a 401k is just overall better than a roth ira. Any thoughts? I just opened a roth a week ago w/o researching enough prior so now I'm wondering if I fucked up.

personalfinance,"My girlfriend and I are planning to get married within the next year and are kind of planning our joined budget. We have a combined base income of 250k (+100k in variable income). We might change industries so I prefer to base my calculations purely on our base income as I think this level is what I feel somewhat confident for us to be able to maintain. My girlfriend contributes 15k to her 401k that is matched by her employer. My employer is less generous and only matches up to 4% of 100k so that's the amount I am currently contributing. We keep around 70k in our checkings account as emergency funds. We have \~60k in a brokerage account, invested in a mix of stocks, ETFs and cash, which serves as our longer-term investing account. Another 25k is parked in HYSAs for shorter-term goals. We dont have Roth IRAs or anything else. No car, no debt, excellent credit.

Our monthly take-home is approximately 12k. This a rough breakdown of our expenses (averaged over a year):

* Rent: 35%
* Living expenses: 40%
* Savings: 25%

We are filling our HSYAs with another 5k and will then put everything towards long-term investing. The variable income is completely put into savings so that helps a bit but as mentioned above I want to optimize without it. 

Also, there is a chance we will not stay in the US once we have kids (maybe in 2-3 years)

**Questions**

1. Are there any bigger issues in our setup that we should fix? Suggestions for smaller optimizations? As far as our savings rate is concerned, I want to optimize spending but am somewhat constrained by the area we live in. Realistically speaking, we can maybe put another 10% into savings but not significantly more than that unless we move. Should I put more into my 401k despite my employer not matching? Should we get Roth IRAs? (both of us are above or at least very close to the upper cap)
2. I am trying to plan our long-term investments. One option I want to consider is investing in real estate, be it our own home (in case we stay) or rental properties for passive income. As our long-term plans are still not clear, I have a preference for building a portfolio of rental properties. How do I best prepare for this during the time we ramp up our equity? How much equity should I target in order to start small? We have both excellent credit scores and ""access"" to NY, GA, FL (primarily thinking about Atlanta and Jacksonville) but I would be open to any region that makes sense. I am specifically looking for information on buying rental properties.

personalfinance,"I recently lost my home in a tornado in Waurn Ponds, Victoria (Australia).

Me and my housemates were renting our home. We were advised by our agent that there is nothing in the Tenancy Act about providing emergency accommodation to us in the circumstances, and the home owners did not have home insurance that provided this either. We are individually couch surfing at friends houses until we can get in our feet to find new homes.

I have limited savings due to paying down significantly on debts for the past two years and paying off a small but continuous credit card debt. I will have my car paid off in about three months if I don’t reduce the payments but am concerned that I need some additional funds right now to assist in rent and bond towards a new rental.

I have contacted Centrelink for some kind of disaster relief or crisis payment, but have essentially been advised that because I am still employed, I am ineligible. 

We haven’t been directed by our agent on where to go for financial or emotional assistance.

Is there anywhere I can go for small financial assistance in the circumstances or is this just something to deal with as a result of my previous financial choices?",I lost my home - what can I do?

personalfinance,"There's also a TLDR at the bottom that heavily summarizes my situation if you're really pressed for time.

I've already had my heart set on the closest state university that offers my career choice.  In fact, I'm pretty much almost 100% done with finalizing everything, getting forms in, etc.  I just need to mail in this one thing and I'll be done, and I'll (probably) start dorming this fall.  Why a state university?  I want to avoid drowning in student loan debt, compared to the tuition costs of other colleges in my state.

However, I originally wanted to just commute to the university, because I was thinking that I could save myself from some extra student loan debt that way.  But after doing the math on how much I would be spending on my commutes, I decided to just go and dorm, since the cost to commute would be around the same as the cost of room and board.  This probably cost me a good amount of potential financial aid, something I've already come to terms with, and I don't mind having some student loan debt.

Alright, so here's some numbers I'd like to share with you. The university is 44 miles from my house, but I have to take local roads for most of my commute, so it's around an hour long drive.  I did the math and for the 2020-2021 semester, using AAA's 2019 average cost of a mile for my type of vehicle (4WD SUV), I would spend around $12k commuting.  Room and board at the university I want to go to is $13k per year, give or take.  Additionally, the tuition is around $11k for a year.  All in all, I'll end up spending around $25k per year on college.  Also, if I do dorm, I save myself some time, time that could be used for homework or reviewing for an exam instead of commuting back to my house, and risking getting stuck in traffic or something.

Sadly, I was not eligible to get any grants from the FAFSA.  This was most likely because of the fact that I had said I would commute and live at home.  If I had said I would dorm, I probably could have gotten some aid.  However, I could have gotten around $5k for the 2020-2021 year in the form of an unsubsidized loan.  I told my parents about this, and after I explained that an unsubsidized loan means that I would start paying interest while I'm in school, they said that they didn't want me to accept it, and I understood why.  So, I declined it.  I also was offered $2k per year academic scholarship from the university, which I did accept.  I've even applied for a few local scholarships, so I'll see how this will go.

Anyways, after informing my parents of my decision to dorm instead, which was probably 3 weeks ago, they did some thinking and have recently (read: probably since the 20th or the 21st, and especially during this past weekend) been trying to persuade me in just going to my local community college, get an associate's degree in the career I want (nursing), and then transfer to a university to get my bachelor's.

Now mind you, I was thinking of going to a community college at first.  I had the mindset that I could do 2 years at a community college, then transfer to a university for 2 more years.  Though, after going to a few college open houses, it seemed like the career choice I wanted would have to just start at a 4 year school, because from what my mother and I were understanding, it would take me 5 years in total if I transferred from the community college, to the universities we were attending open houses at.  So, we just started to assume that most university in my state does that.  That is why, when I found out I got accepted at the state university I want to go to, I decided to go all in and reserve my seat.  My parents never bothered me about making a decision until I told them in early May that I wanted to go and dorm there instead.

Based on what I understand from talking with my parents, they say they found out that there is a way to get a bachelor's degree in 4 years if I went to a community college.  I believe it involves having a university give me a free ride, with the requirement that I have exceptional grades.  Or at least, a tuition cost that's cut in half.  My parents say that that's what one person did. That's why they're persuading me to go to my local community college.  They're basically hoping I can bank on a free ride.  They also try to persuade me with emotions, saying stuff like ""You don't want to see your parents anymore?"".  In my mind, I honestly would say that I want to start experiencing what it's like living independently, and experience some of the hardships involved, but I don't have the heart to tell them that.

One thing I want to point out is, I don't even know if the community college will still accept people this late in the year.  My parents think they will still open their doors for me, given that there's a pandemic, which I understand.  I personally don't think it's possible anymore because of how late in the year it is.  But who knows, I emailed them a few hours before writing this thread, and I've yet to receive a response.  That's why I'm writing this thread, in the case that they do respond with ""Yes, we will still take you.""

If you've made it this far, you now understand why I'm torn right now.  I've already mostly finalized all my papers, I've chosen a roommate already, I've already gotten to know my potential roommate pretty well, I've already made a bunch of friends from the unofficial 2024 facebook group to the point where I won't feel as shy coming into college.  I've just spent so much time thinking about this university that now there's more to this than just the money.  It's just that, although the social stuff does matter to me, I've also been considering the financial standpoint in all of this.  I understand that in general, transferring from a community college will usually be cheaper than 4 years in a university.

So all I ask is just your two cents on what I should do.  I will appreciate any comment, even the harsh ones.  We all need to be brought back down to earth sometime.  Also, if you need some extra elaboration on anything, I'll gladly give it to you, and I'll also make sure to edit this thread to clarify.

TLDR: I'm almost done finalizing my stuff for a state university, but after telling my parents I want to dorm instead, they recently started trying to persuade me to go to a community college.  I'm kinda torn because I know community college is usually cheaper, but as I've said before, I'm almost done finalizing stuff for this state university.",I'm a high school senior NOW undecided about my college path mostly because of money.

personalfinance,"So, my wife has hit on a thing with certain Facebook groups where interested parties are willing to reimburse her for purchases on Amazon. These usually are in return for reviews, but she doesn't do those, just the ones seeking to get items sold, boost their listings that way. Yes, this is not well liked by Amazon, but that's not the source of my question. 

How do I approach this tax/income wise? She is usually reimbursed though sometimes she is prepaid to purchase the items. They usually do not cover PayPal fees, which is how it's returned, nor taxes, which we pay when we purchase the items cause we are in a sales tax state. 

Do I need to be worried about the money she's being reimbursed for these purchases? The fact that it is multiple, odd transactions from China already has me uneasy, but seems fairly common place. Is there a threshold I should observe to avoid any potential tax implications?

personalfinance,"Hey guys, am not American. I was born in Eastern Europe and went to study in the UK and work as a software dev for around 2.5 years. Short family history: disabled uncle, quite ill grandfather. Me and my brother grew up under one roof with them together. My mother lost her job in 2008 crisis and due to us living in a small town, she could not find anything else but working in a supermarket. She worked there for 12 years. She recently dropped a bomb to me about her being tired of work (she is 51 years old). I asked why, and she said probably issue with heart. So, I sent her to private GP who heard something wrong with her heart. Possibly congestive heart failure. We will go to cardiologist but that GP is excellent and never was wrong when I had issues.

My issue is this: she earned minimum wage for 12 years working in the supermarket, so does not have much saved. In addition, my grandfather since his surgery for some colon issue, is not realistically expected to survive more than 5 years (optimistically).

He took care of my mother's disabled brother (my uncle) for decades. Mom helped where she could. So, I am faced with possible death of both caretakers. I do not live in my home country and am not interested in sacrificing my life for a person I hate (the uncle was always an asshole to me and my brother, long story). He is able to walk around the house, but he needs help with many things, he could not prepare himself a meal most likely, etc. It is not his fault he was born this way, it is not genetic, it was a birth accident that caused slight brain trauma and made him the way he is.

My brother is 25, I am 27. Our father was always absent from our lives and I do not think he would take care of the uncle. His own mother is in ill health and probably won't last longer than 5 years. My father earns average money but he is tired of working as well (age 55). They have no idea what pensions are, investing or anything never occurred to them despite them being relatively intelligent. Typical boomers tbh.

I do not know what to do. I am happy to take care of my mother, so stopping the work and pay her something every month. Maybe try to learn a job that won't require physical work. 

But I don't want to sacrifice my life and future for the uncle. I don't like him and he never helped me with anything. Every dollar I spend on them is stealing from my future children or my own finances.

I’m looking for something fun to do for the summer. I have $300 to spend max. I either want a mountain bike, roller blades or an electric scooter. Yes I’m a 17 year old girl and this is what I want to do. I know it’s unusual and weird but hey it’s exercise and I’m out of the house. 

Here’s the problem - we moved into this house in 2016ish, my friend Aubree, gave me a free mountain bike about two years ago and my parents were pissed because we have a small cluttered garage and the bike kept scratching up against the car anytime my dad backed in. (I can’t clean the garage, he has OCD and will flip if anyone moves anything). So he made me get rid of the bike, ride it to my friends house and keep it there, because there was no room for it here. Her parents made her get rid of it because they have too many bikes. He got a brand new car in November. So definitely can’t keep the bike in the garage. He will probably be mad if another bike shows up here period. I was thinking I could keep it outside in the mulch on the side of the house but idk if it sitting in the sun constantly would do anything. There is snowy winters here, but I could take the tires off the bike and put them somewhere and place the body vertically against the wall. I was going to get a huffy bike because it was a pretty good bike. It’s about $170-$215 depending. 

2. An electric commuter scooter. The GOTRAX GXL one is $250. I’ve rode these scooters around when I was on vacation in Santa Monica before and they are fun. I want to own one. My mom thinks they are a waste of money and too expensive. She told me I can just wait until we go on vacation again. I could ride the scooter around my neighborhoods or around walking trails. There’s no sidewalks on the roads where I live but they do have bike lanes. It’s a growing suburban/rural area. About an hour and a half drive from the city. Lots of homes are being built here. But you have to drive to get anywhere. No crosswalk signals or walkways. Nothing is walking distance.

3. Roller blades $130-175. I had a pair of roller blades that my dad tossed out last year. I had them since I was 9. The brake completely was worn off, there was no brake and the left tire had a crack in it. We also live in a hilly neighborhood area, so going down the roads really fast.

Here's my ugly kitchen. I'm debating on if I want to update it at all or just leave it as is. Nothing is in bad shape, just outdated. Some options I've thought:

Getting the cabinets painted white. If I did this though, would the counters/back-splash match?
Just doing a new back splash. Something with darker blues in it to counter the 90's wood look of the cabinets.
The up-down-up-down of the top cabinets are kinda weird, so I thought about just removing the cabinet over the fridge, or even moving the 2 ""down"" cabinets to the very top, but the wall behind those cabinets are not painted the same color. Also, the back-splash would have to be redone to match the new height of the ""down"" cabinets.
Redoing just the floor to a newer white tile or some sort of LVP. The same tile flows into the dining room though so I'd rather have to continue in there as well or stop at the kitchen edge. Dining room picture... forgot to attach to original gallery
Just replacing the counter-top with a darker granite/quartz counter-top.
Just putting in a new stainless stove/microwave.
I for sure am going to put in some kind of track or pendant light to replace the ugly utility light.
A full gut and replace is not in the budget.

Approximately $25,000 is now at Vanguard in a mutual fund (AGTHX) American Funds Growth Fund of America Class A. 

I would like get away from this mutual fund and buy VSTAX. What I’ve learned is that our current fund has a load fee of 5.75% and some other type of fee of .25%. 

I did not pick the AGTHX, and I’m bummed to learn we are going to pay a fee. I don’t have anyone to blame I suppose, but I know I would not have picked this. The financial advice his grandma got was questionable. Let’s just say he made a delightful amount of commission off her. 

My question boils down to this; how do I sell this mutual fund and buy the VSATX? Is it really as easy as hitting sell, then buying what I want? Am I triggering a tax bill? Will that 6% fee be deducted from the sell? 

Thanks in advance!",Need advice/help selling mutual fund for EFT.

personalfinance,"I (25M) am currently working towards purchasing a condo. While getting pre-approval today it was discovered that two of my moms credit cards are linked to my credit. I assumed this was due to the fact that when I was 18 she opened a card in my name and put herself as an authorized user so that I could begin establishing credit. I was also at one point an authorized user on one of her cards.

I decided to use a service like credit karma to get some more details to sort this out. When creating an account it asks you to answer some questions about your credit to verify your identity . This is where it got weirder. The first question was along the lines of “we see you have a mortgage that was taken out in [month] of [year], through what bank was this mortgage?”. I have absolutely no idea why it would be associating my mom’s mortgage with my credit.

In 2018, I was getting set up with my therapists billing woman and talked to her on the phone about 7 times over the course of two months. Every time I spoke to her, she was clearly disorganized, needed reminders for everything, responded to emails with poor grammar and lots of typos, etc. 

I should have known from that moment I needed to keep detailed records, but I went ahead and stupidly trusted it would all work out. 

The past few bills I've gotten from her, which I haven't paid yet, include dates of sessions from 2018. I was billed monthly in 2018 so why wouldn't those have been paid for at that time? 

I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do besides track down every check I've written for her and add it up to see how much I've paid in total. Still, it's not like the sessions were on a regular schedule. Sometimes I went twice a week and other times I didn't go for a month, so I really don't know how many times I've been. 

Maybe a dumb question but is there any kind of legal 'expiration date' for a bill? Like it kind of throws a wrench in my finances to be billed now for something I thought I already paid two years ago.

personalfinance,"I have good credit and plenty amount of cash on hand to be able to buy a car outright if I wanted to, but the one thing holding my credit back from being the best it could be is lack of installment loan history. Since I may be looking to buy a house in a few years, I'd like to address that if I can do so in a cheap and risk-free way. So my idea is to buy a car with a 0% financing promotional period, and then to be safe - since I've seen a horror story or two on here of some fluke causing someone to forget to pay it off before the period ends - pay almost all of the loan off right after the purchase and just leave $500 or something due to make sure that there is still technically a loan. It seems to me like this would be a nice way to build installment loan credit while still avoiding the cost usually associated with that, even if I somehow mess up and don't pay the last $500 (or whatever amount) before the end of the promotional 0% interest period. But this seems like such an obvious trick to get all the benefit with none of the cost/risk, that I'm wondering if there's something I'm overlooking here that would keep this from working like I think it would. Thoughts? Would an auto loan be basically disregarded for my credit history if they see I didn't actually borrow the money in the conventional sense of owing it for a long time?

personalfinance,"So, unfortunately I took out a ton of loans to pay for undergrad, and now I have 97k in private loans and another 30k in federal loans. Every time I think about how much I owe it makes me regret going to school. The fortunate thing is I'm in a good field that is growing as I did my undergrad in statistics. 

I'm currently making 62k a year before taxes and make a monthly payment of $700 to the private loans and 350 to the federal loans. I also pay 870 currently for my apartment which includes utilities. I live a pretty simple lifestyle so I don't have many expenses outside of that besides food/groceries and the occasional night out with friends. I've been considering going to grad school to get my master's in computer science. I would be going part-time and would be on a payment plan that would have me pay $865 a month and I don't want to take out any more loans to pay for it. 

I have three options on how I could handle this. I could stay at home with my parents and take the train for two hours to get to work and aggressively pay off my student loans while paying for grad school and pretty much graduate with no more private loans and then start working on the federal student loans after I graduate. However, I know for a fact I would be miserable living at home, my parents are really strict and I would be pretty far from my friends. I would be basically giving up my freedom for 3 years to get out of debt. Not to mention commuting 4 hours a day would be hell. 

The other option to make things a bit easier is to stay at home and buy a car which would extend my payoff time by a year but I would save nearly two hours a day in my commute. The last option is renting an apartment or buying a condo. 

In terms of cost, a one-bedroom near campus is going to cost me around 1600 a month, which is how much it would cost me to buy a condo possibly less. And by buying a condo at least my payments are going towards owning property. Not to mention I could rent it out later on and make money off of it. I know there are going to be more costs associated with owning a property in terms of maintenance. 

In the long run, gradating grad school with significantly less debt would be the best choice, but I'm already seeing a therapist for my depression, and staying at home would not help. Should I just try to make it through the 3 years at home and then look into buying a condo? Or should I take the chance and buy my own place while the interest rates are low and start paying the debt after I graduate. If I do buy a condo I would still try to pay the interest for my loans so the debt doesn't grow.",Stay at home and pay off my student loans or buy a condo?

personalfinance,"I am going to purchase a house in Florida, and have a verbal offer in for the purchase that's accepted.  I just need to get the down payment in order along with like insurance etc....but the focus here is the down payment.  

Long story short -- I think it's the life insurance piggy bank to raid.  Am I thinking about this correctly?  It's more a short-term liquidity need, more than an asset problem.   

Assets are the question -- where to pull from?  I have an apartment in Manhattan, and that had been rented until late last year, but co-op rules being what they are, it currently sits vacant, and it's sort of the one illiquid asset in my portfolio at the moment.  I do intend and hope to sell it in the next 12 months for net 1.25x to 1.4x what I am paying for the Florida house, for context.  I would then pull out around 100% of the mortgage cost on the Florida apartment in cash equity out of the Manhattan sale at that stage.  So liquidity won't be an issue then.  

So, the question is, in the meantime, where do I pull the cash down payment from?  In terms of my wife and I, outside of the Manhattan apartment, we have about 5x the cost of the Florida house in investment accounts, some pre-tax, some post tax (Roth), as well as in Universal Life Insurance.  

I initially was going to pull from the initial contributions of my Roth IRAs, since you can do that without tax consequences.  But then tonight on my walk, I was like ""That's the dumbest thing you can do, "" because it's a sandbox I cannot re-fill.  I can't borrow from it, and I can't ""over-contribute"" to it to build it back up when I sell Manhattan, so I'm basically burning 18 more years of compounded tax-free growth on that contribution.  It was like a ""You're an idiot"" Eureka moment, that prompted this post.  Those contributions were like 33% of the total cost of the house and easily the downpayment, so now I'm in a bit of a shell game.  

Another possible source is our 401(k) which won't happen -- that's not even up for discussion with penalties and tax implications.  That leaves 2 more options:


1)  I have put aside money for my kid's college -- they are very young (1 and 3)-- and I could borrow from them and pay them back with interest for the down payment.  It's basically enough for 20% + closing costs.  


2)  I could borrow from my Universal Life policies, which are currently cash valued at 1.75x the entire cost of the house.  Those grow tax deferred as long as they stay in force, that sand pit can be refilled by ""over-contributions"" to pay it back, and although there are costs involved, it seems like the least painful place to pull from.  Using conservative growth assumptions, they're funded til I'm 88 or so,  so doing this won't demolish those accounts, and I could look to refill the loan as soon as I sell Manhattan.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is a business owner of a corner store, and business is not so good. I am sure he is looking for a job change but we have no idea where to look!

&amp;#x200B;

Some background information regarding him:  
\-Graduated with mathematics and computer science; was a programmer for IBM but was laid off during 9/11/2001. Couldn't find a job for a year so his brother in law helped him out by helping him set up a corner store

\-He is pretty healthy at his age, but I would prefer if he isn't dealing with too much manual labor.

&amp;#x200B;

Since he has so many years of experience of owning a business, what are some jobs he could try to apply to?

For a while, I agonized over every little purchase and didn't do the things that made me happy because I was afraid if I didn't get my emergency fund set up RIGHT NOW I would get hit by a car and end up in the poorhouse. At the time I was doing automatic deposit, which I thought was the best method. $100 a week equals a million somewhere down the line, right? But every time my financial situation fluctuated, I kept having to constantly readjust my distributions and worry each week over if I was going to be able to make the $75 deposit by Friday or if I should call the bank and get them to change it to $50. Would going bi-weekly help? 


You get the idea. Lots of anxiety over having a consistent deposit. Now, I have a very simple system. First, I figured out which of my expenses were essential, things that I could not live without paying for. These were the mortgage, groceries, utilities, bills, that sort of thing. Now, for every dollar I spend on something non-essential, like a new video game or some fast food, I match in my savings account. It's taken a huge load off my mind because I'm not Keeping Up With The Joneses-ing myself by worrying about if this week's automatic deposit will be ""enough.""

Now don't think I'm doing anything crazy like hoarding receipts and making notes of every single non-essential item on my grocery list!  If I hear the person in the drive thru say it'll be $13.69, I make a mental note of it and pop $14 into Ally's high yield savings account when I get home. This method has given me much more freedom in how I approach my savings. If money gets tight, you stop spending on non-essentials, and your savings rate automatically shrinks.

When I purchased the home in 2012, I was pre-approved and had a deal arranged.

And on that date, the home found itself in direct path of Hurricane Sandy. The home was undamaged, but my lender backed out pending further inspections; it was the last straw for the seller. A family member offered enough cash to save the deal. I accepted, bought the home outright, then took out home equity to pay back the private loan. The purchase price was 189k; it was a 20 year loan for 151k at 4.9%.

I'm 21 years old and working in a tech industry which is primarily contract, and over the last two years I've accrued a savings which I would personally consider sizable (obviously perspective is everything here) of 50k. As of this month I am, for the first time, making a consistent 4.5k per month, previously it was anywhere between 2k - 7k, so taking budgeting into account I can pretty safely predict I will be somewhere in the 65k range when my current lease ends at the beginning of next year.

- What is the most important thing I should be doing for the remaining 6 months before my lease is up to prepare, besides save?
- What would be a smart down payment to place on the initial home, and what does it make sense to be doing for the period of time that I am living there? Renovations, etc.

personalfinance,"I am trying to figure out if I should pay down my house mortgage and then rent it out, or if should just sell the property. Hoping you could give me advice.

My story. I have the ability to pay off the $241k owed on my home loan in about 4 years time (potentially quicker if I wanted to).  This will be done through a variety of means such as selling RSUs, ESPP,  having freed up cash from not paying for my wife's school. I estimate I could rent my house out for $1,900 a month. Management fees (i'm still looking into this) would be $169 a month. Taxes/escrow are about $380 per month, and then i'm stating about $200 in repairs. Overall, I would be able to receive $1,150 a month. Then, if i were to get taxed on that, I would have about $782 a month profit (Guessing 32% tax rate on income). I then went ahead and did a  future value of annuity calculation (with 7% I/Y) and found that in 10 years, I could make about $135k, $407k (20 years), $954k (30 years). As well... If at any point I sold my house, after however many years, I would be able to add an additional $360k, minus tax which would equal $245k. So max is about $1.2 million over 30 years of ownership with full investment of every penny I get back.

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, I have been living here for over the 2 year requirement to not get taxed on the house up to $500k (House is worth $360 right now i believe). If I were just to sell the house , and invest that in some account that makes the same 7% interest, after 30 years alone on just the house sell, minus taking out the 32% on profit, I would have $905k alone. If I put in the about $60k that I would  use per year to pay of the house, I would have another $331k after 30 years. If I did that for each of the next 4 years (making note the investment time for FV is going to be 1 year less each time), I could net $2.1M .

&amp;#x200B;

So what am I missing here? Is it just a terrible idea to fully buy my house, and then rent it? I just refi'd down tot a 3.25% or something around there on a new 30. However, I don't think it would be worth renting for the next 30 years owing money on it. I mean, I would get a little bit of income, but it would be only a few hundred a month.

Great, everything should be find, property tax/insurance did go up, and  $300 -/+ makes sense.

**It also shows a shortage of $7600** \- this kind of freaked me out because I know my dad pays his mortgages on time, and entire monthly balance due, so I don't know where this high amount of shortage is coming from?  I started to look into all of his statements and noticed his been paying the **Annual Escrow** which is **$7700 / 12 = $641/month**  and shortage from 2018-19 which is again another **$7600 /12 = $630/ month**. 

So his statement shows his paying **$641 Escrow current** and another **$630 in** **Escrow shortage balance**, and his **interest** and **principle.**

Apparently he had the same amount of shortage last year too, which he was making up for... I didn't know what to think at this point so I registered my dad at the banks website so I can review 7 years of statements, it seem this has been on going since 2014... his been paying a shortage of 7000+ every year?

 - 20/week eating out 
 - 20/week “fun” 
 - 20/week miscellaneous (toilet paper, ibuprofen, burnt out light bulb etc)

Let’s try the new taco joint, how about the fajitas and a margarita), that’s around 125 a week. I’m also very active so I need around 3k calories/day.

Hey, this is my first post to Reddit, let alone this subreddit so I’m not completely sure of how everything here works yet so bear with me.

I’m 16 and around October last year, my dad had opened a bank account for me since I had just gotten my first check from my job. Everything was going great until I made the stupid decision of giving someone my bank information, leading to my account getting closed due to fraudulent activity, and me getting banned from Chase Bank as a whole. (FYI, my dad doesn’t know about me giving out my bank info, he believes that I got hacked.)

Later this week I’m going to see if I can have another account opened but under my aunt since my dad’s account under Chase was frozen for unrelated reasons. I just had some anxiety about this entire situation and had some questions:

1. As a minor, does this go on any record of mine that would prevent me from taking any banking actions in the future?

2. Do other banks see that I am banned from Chase Bank and would that influence their decision to allow me to open an account?

3. If I’m unable to open any other bank account in the near future, are there any other options that I have? (i.e, surviving without a bank account, mobile banking services, etc.)

personalfinance,"Hey PF! Long time reader, first time poster. In the past couple years, I have focused on paying off credit card and student loan debt, and started emergency fund savings. I’m finally in a place where I feel like I can get organized around retirement savings and am looking for some guidance on how to manage existing retirement accounts from past employers, and how to handle retirement savings moving forward. I am currently renting in a HCOL area and would like to be a homeowner one day, but am not sure if this is possible in addition to saving for retirement.

A bit about me and my situation:

* 31(F), single, no kids (but maybe one day), renting in HCOL area with a single income source from salaried job
* Job is pretty stable. Although nothing in life is certain, I’m thankfully not too worried about job security right now
* Annual income before taxes $120,000 (started this job about a year ago and the first time making this much, so was able to pay off debt)
* I do budget regularly and have been contributing \~$1,200/month to emergency fund savings and will do so through the end of the year.  Should have a 6-month emergency fund by the end of the year (it’s currently funded at about 3 months)
* Current employer offers a 401(k), but no employer match/contribution
* Have a couple 401(k) accounts from past employers that I haven’t done anything with
* MAGI for 2019 and 2020 should each be under $124k
* Would like to buy a house one day and would like to start saving for a downpayment

I have read about Roth vs Traditional when it comes to both 401(k) and IRA accounts, but I am unsure how these options apply to rollover accounts, and also unsure of if I’ll be making significantly more or less when I retire. It’s hard to know if I’ll still be in good health and working in 30 years. While my current salary is more than I’ve ever made and I hope to save much of it, I would also like to think that I do have more earning potential. 

**Question 1**: What should I do with 2 existing 401(k) plans from previous employers? I think these are both Traditional 401(k) accounts so my understanding is that I would be able to roll these accounts over into a single traditional 401(k) or IRA. Does it make sense to roll these both over to a Traditional IRA?

* Past Employer 1 401(k): $15,000
* Past Employer 2 401(k): $3,000

**Question 2:** Where should I save for retirement now/moving forward? When it comes to 401(k) or IRA, I think it makes more sense to prioritize IRA first since my employer doesn’t match. Roth or Traditional?

* I think I can contribute a max of $6,000 to an IRA for this year. Should it be Roth or Traditional? 
* Given that my employer does not match any funds, does it make sense to contribute to a 401(k) in addition to the annual IRA contribution? Or would it be better to keep extra retirement savings in some sort of HYSA or invest it?

**Question 3:** Am I right to prioritize retirement savings over saving for a downpayment, or is there a way to contribute to both?

I own a car that I bought lightly used in cash four years ago. I have no car payments, very little maintenance, and it's a plug-in hybrid that I charge at work, so I don't really pay for gas either (literally &lt;$50 a year). 

I pay my parents a tiny ""rent"" of about $500 a month, plus buying them nice dinners at least once a week. Monthly rents in my area can easily be over $2000 so I'm really getting spoiled here. 

My student loans are all paid off, and I have no credit card debt, or debt of any kind. 

I hardly buy anything for myself. For leisure I mostly play sports and old video games, so my discretionary spending is only a few hundred dollars a year. 

I have tried to use YNAB and similar things a couple times, but each time I got confused and gave up because I have so much saved and I have so few expenses that the numbers never matched up in any meaningful way. 

My main goal is to move out. My two main questions are:

- its it financially feasible for me to live on my own? I would be open to bringing on a roommate(s) if necessary, but I would really like to live on my own if possible. I wouldn't mind a small space like a studio apartment. 
- what things do I need to learn right away in order to manage my money on my own? 

I'm not in a rush and not planning on making any changes until the pandemic situation cools off, but I also don't want to waste this time. Looking for ways I can make progress toward this goal while being cooped up inside - things I need to learn, financial things I should be setting up, etc. Thanks in advance for any advice.",Moving out of my parents' house
personalfinance,"I currently invest enough of my paycheck to get my employer match in my 401K, which is invested into a moderate 2055 Target Date Fund through Fidelity. Now I’m looking to set aside another few hundred dollars per month into a Roth IRA, also through Fidelity. I chose the Target Date Fund for the 401K because it seemed like the safest choice, so I’m wondering if I should trust the experts and also put my Roth IRA contributions into the same (or similar) fund, or if I should diversify and select something else, such as a Large Cap ETF or Mutual Funds?

personalfinance,"As far as I know, an IRA lets you contribute tax-advantaged money which then grows tax free (eg no capital gains tax), but you are taxed as regular income (for interest and principle) when you start withdrawing when you retire. Based on my current retirement planning, my average tax rate would be around 20%.  


However, long term capital gains are taxes at 15%. Wouldn't I be better off to just put money into a mutual fund and let it grow for 40 years? Then I would only be taxed 15% on the interest.

personalfinance,"Hello everyone,

I just turned 18 and feel very behind. It’s quite embarrassing for me to admit just how much I don’t know. 

To start off, I’ve never had a job. My parents have always wanted me to focus on school and sports. We are relatively well off so I’ve never had to help them financially. I’ve pretty much gotten whatever I’ve wanted as long as I kept a high GPA, stayed respectful, and helped clean the house. I’ve definitely lived a pretty privileged life and I’m extremely grateful. 

My problem is that I don’t know how real life works. I think my parents are having a hard time letting go and don’t think that I have to worry much yet. I feel like that’s pretty irresponsible. I have no savings (to my knowledge), I don’t have a debit or credit card, and overall just don’t have much of an understanding of personal finance.

personalfinance,"I was working at a CUNY school (basically three jobs... PhD student and also paid research assistant and also adjunct lecturer, all of which are separate). The main salary and also main duties was being a researcher, working for a specific scientist, who quit with no warning. For a few months after that, I only taught and was only paid to teach, but I don't think anything really changed. Then after the semester ended, they didn't renew my contract for either being a researcher becuase the person I was researching for was gone, and I also left the PhD program and did not get picked up to teach any more. This was the 2018-2019 academic year ending last June, and I didn't file becuase I thought I would be able to find a new job quickly, and. Once the pandemic started and I saw hiring basically stop I realized it would take a long time to find a new job, so I filed right away, in March. Yes, I know it was stupid to wait so long, I don't have a reason for doing that. But it seems that they base your eligibility on your declared income from the last 5 quarters (based on something on the NY DOL website I had to fill out) and I had income for 3 of those. I said I was unemployed due to lack of work, which I think is an accurate representation of the facts because I was basically put out of work due to the PhD advisor leaving and therefore I was not getting paid to research and the department didn't hire me back to teach anymore afterwards, as they only hire active graduate students.

Anyway I have been getting UI plus the 600/month coronavirus boost for about a month, but yesterday (5/23) I got a letter (dated 5/5) saying that I may not be eligible because I worked for an educational institution. It had some questions in it, such as who I worked for, how much I was paid, was it part time or full time etc. It said if a response isn't recieved within 7 days (so, by 5/12) they would determine eligiblity based on info they already have, so I guess they would ignore my questionaire. It also said benefits will be frozen until they determine anything. However I still got deposits on 5/12, 5/18, and 5/20 (some was for back-dating benefits to march when I applied, as I didn't start getting any deposits until 5/11 even though I applied on 3/20 or something like that). I don't know if this means I passed, or everythign is delayed, or what. I was able to certify for this week today on the department of labor website. Nothing appears to be different on the website.

I also had like five different job titles and was paid from a lot of difference sources when working at the school. PhD student, research assistant, graduate assistant, adjunct, adjunct professor... I was paid from the chemistry department, from the university as a whole, from my PhD advisor's research grants, from the department's research foundation, from the individual college within the unviersity... generally all at the same time, on different W2s, some paid hourly, some paid salary, some paid two lumps per year, etc. I have no idea how to handle any of this paperwork, which i regardless don't have anymore because I had a flood. On my iniital application I just said I was a research assistant becuase that was what I considered to be my main job.

I honestly have no idea if I broke any rules or misrepresented anything. I tried to be as honest as possible but the paperwork and bureaucracy of the university system is so complicated that I don't even know how to answer questions like ""who did you work for"" and ""were you full time or hourly"" or ""how much were you paid""... When they asked who I worked for, I said the university because that's where I physically went to work, but who my actual on-paper employer is is... complicated. I am fortunately in a position where I won't be totally screwed if they cut off benefits, but I might be totally screwed if they try to take back the ~7 weeks of benefits they paid out already. I also don't know if I can get some kind of penalty or credit hit or judgement against me or something for being accidentally in the wrong here.

Sorry for the wall of text, I'm freaking out a bit here.","(US, NY) Unemployment might be taken back becuase I worked at a university? I don't know if I did something wrong here."

2. I started to invest and max out on Roth IRA this year. I have $6,500 in this account.
3. I have \~$3,000 in Robinhood.
4. I have \~$2,000 in a high-interest savings account (emergency fund).

Debt:

1. I have $28,000 in student loans (I consolidated my student loans to 3.49% with a minimum payment of \~$700 a month). Originally, I owed $47,000 by the time I finished college and have paid off almost $20k since I started my career 1.5 years ago. 
2. I have no credit card debt or any other debt.

After a car repo and several other young adult mistakes over the last six years, I had gotten my credit score to the upper 600s... 

Then Edfinancial (school loans) says I opted for paperless billing, which I think they mistakenly did, and it caused me to go a couple months late on payments. I relied heavily on receiving the physical letter every month as a reminder.

Given my several individual loans from Edfinancial (10 total I believe), I received 20 ish late remarks on my credit report, tanking me back down to 530.

Is this something that I could submit a credit report appeal for? The whole task seems daunting and definitely unlikely, but I figured I'd seek some advice. Looking at houses in the next couple years and I need to fix as much as I can.

personalfinance,"I apologise if this subject has been discussed before but I couldn't find a relative thread. 

I've seen many discussions about investment allocation (bonds vs stocks etc) within a certain account, but I was wondering if anyone has a strategy for balancing multiple accounts at the same time. For example, I currently have a 401k, a Roth IRA, and a HSA that I invest through. Given that I'm in my early 30s, I think I can afford to be pretty aggressive with my investments but I'm not sure if I should balance that risk within each account or across all 3.

To break it down even further, I'm debating among 2 main strategies:

A. 401k - leave it on target date index funds (agressive to low risk over time)

Roth IRA - aggressive, stock-heavy, high risk

HSA - conservative, bond-heavy low risk



B. Allocate each account to a 80% stock / 20% bond mix and gradually shift it over time to more conservative.



Is one of these 2 strategies better than the other or should I consider something different altogether? I appreciate any ideas/suggestions.",Balancing 401k vs Roth IRA vs HSA
personalfinance,"After college in my early twenties, I went through periods of low pay and unemployment. With student loan debt on my record, I actually had an excellent credit score however. Young and dumb, I got sucked into those 0% APR promo periods thinking that of course I would have a better paying job by the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, I racked up  \~$21k in credit card debt. For the past 4-5 years I stopped using credit cards entirely, I don't have a spending problem. But those balances were barely inching down since all of the minimum payments alone were a burden to handle. I have never missed a payment, but my credit was shot because of utilization.

&amp;#x200B;

In these past few years, my salary has increased from $65k to $70k, and now $85k. I finally started to get serious about paying it off this year. I've knocked off about $10k so far, \~$11k to go. I'm on track to finish it off before January, barring any employment disruptions with everything going on in the world right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is 708, I want to reduce the amount of interest that I'm still paying monthly. I looked into balance transfer cards but it seems none of the 0 fee cards are available at the moment. My balance is split across 4 cards, so paying a transfer fee will get hefty.

$11,000 loan  
5 years

$234.33/month  
10.11%APR

I still plan to pay this off by January, and there are no penalties for paying early.

personalfinance,"I’ve created a one-person business. The business is making around 40-50K/month in revenue and around 25-35K/month in profit. It’s been stable and growing since I’ve created it a little over a year ago. And things are running themselves. It’s 90% passive income, with 10% of the active work being creating new products for customers and checking in on online advertisements.

The problem is that I’m coming to terms with an addiction to money/profit. I have an addictive personality, which is why I’ve always avoided smoking or gambling. Instead, I focused on other things in life like creating art and creating this small side-business to help others. But when the money started rolling in faster than I could fathom, more and more of my focus started centering on something I wasn’t expecting — money. Less of my focus is now on creating art and creating new content, which is disappointing to myself as it’s why I started doing this in the first place.

After some reflection, I have enough self-awareness to realize that this will become a major problem unless it’s addressed soon. I’m in graduate school, and I‘m  spending less of my energy on my studies. Every 30 minutes to an hour, I feel the need to check on how “things are going” and find myself distracted from the things that matter. I don’t want to become motivated by money, but it’s happening, and I’m feeling a lot of cognitive dissonance.

I have spent the last two years really dialing in my future and trying to set myself up for success over the next 10 years and I've realized the system in So Cal is impossible to get ahead.

By the time I do what most people say is best - Max out my 401K, max out my Roth IRA, save an emergency fund of at least 6 months - and then pay my bills, I am not left with much. Even saving 25% of my weekly check wouldn't put me in a good standing to put 20% on a house in the next 3 years. and that's making $105K! which we were told growing up is significant. Not to mention, saving for a ring, and enjoying life without having to worry about all of this shit.

The housing market is fucked in So Cal. $500K gets you a 2 bedroom shack that needs complete renovation in the middle of nowhere Menifee - yes, most of you that aren't in cali, have probably never even heard of Menifee.

Anywhere reputable in southern california for a decent 3 bedroom two bath 1500 sq ft home you're looking at around $650-800K. And that home will likely need some work and have outdated bathrooms and kitchen that you will then feel the pressure from your peers to modernize it. And what makes it worse is that society will sell you the impression as a first time home buyer that you can qualify for a loan putting down only 3.5 percent! Putting down 3.5 percent on a 30-year mortgage for a $700K house in my opinion is like signing up for a timeshare vacation in Wuhan.

Honestly i hope the housing market resets itself and pricing comes back down to give us somewhat of a fighting chance. Especially the millennials that spent their twenties actually trying to get ahead. Because at the moment, if you don't make at least $150K in so cal, you're going to need to align your dreams that we were told to dream to the reality of what your hard earned dollar will really get you...

personalfinance,"employers have fired people during Covid crisis, so that they can claim unemployment. After employers received PPP, they are kind of greedy, and not want to pay it to the employees and coming up with Novel reasons! as this money need not be returned to the Govt.

If employers find a way to not pay workers, can they pocket the PPP? wouldn't it be a fraud, since they initially received the money for keeping all employees on payroll.

an example:

Employees who got fired due to Covid applied for new jobs and got offers. The current employer says, they cannot pay from PPP as the employee is anyways leaving the firm and they rather hire new employee. 

shouldn't the employer pay them from PPP irrespective. I think it is a trick played by employer to keep the money allocated for Covid unemployment.

My mom (now divorced) is in her mid-50s and makes good money as a physician in a LCOL area. Prior to divorce, my dad handled the finances, but he was quite conservative throughout his life - and now that my mom is on her own, she's trying to figure out how to manage the money.

We’re a single income family with two kids. My annual income is $220k. We have about $400k in equity in our current home, and we could pay for the new house in cash if we wanted to.

I make **$4751/month after taxes and health insurance contribution**, though this amount **might go down to about $4301/month** as I noticed my employer has not been withholding social security and medicare taxes. 

My current expenses are such:

| Monthly Fixed Expenses      | Needs| Wants     |
|:-----------                 |:------------|:------------ |
| Phone Bill: $55             | Food: $250  |     Eating out: $150
| Prescription Medication $20 | Other necessities (toiletries, etc.): $150   |  Other: $150
| Disney+: $6.99              | Gas: $50       |   
| Spotify: $2.50||
| Six Flags Membership: $8.96 ||
| Total: $93.45| Total: $450 | Total: $300

This leaves **$3907.55** after my expenses currently, which goes fully into a savings account. However, note that things like car insurance (about $1,000 every 6 months) and car maintenance are not in that monthly budget. I figured when the time comes I'll just reduce the amount I save that month. Another thing to note is that I'm **NOT** currently contributing to a retirement account. I'm on an F1 OPT visa and I'm not sure a 401k makes sense for me if I have to leave the country in 2 or so years so I have to save for retirement for myself.

I have been looking around for places and the places that are walking distance to my office, and the cheapest I can find are about $1200. However, if I keep my car I would have to pay about $60/month for parking in a garage about 30 minutes away, or $230/month for parking in a garage at that place. A more comfortable place walking distance would probably be about $1500, with the same cost in parking. I could possibly just sell my car if it makes the most financial sense so I can save in parking and car insurance/maintainence. **Total cost for this option: $1260-$1730.**

Alternatively, I can stay a 30-40 minute drive from my office, though with traffic the commute might be longer at 40-50 minutes. In this case, my rent can be as low as $650, but I would have to pay more for gas and my overall quality of life would decrease due to the commute. A more comfortable place in this second option would probably be about $800. I would still have to pay for parking near my office at about $230/month. **Total cost for this option: $950-$1100 but with a drop in quality of life.**

Basically, I should have \~$13,647 a month to spend after all my expenses including food are taken care of. 

My plan with that was to make sure I save in some form or another $8,333.33/month (or $100,000 in the year). I would first build up my HYSA to a 6-month total (about $30,000), then I was thinking of opening a brokerage account with Charles Schwab to start actually investing. I was going to do it myself after doing a bunch of reading, I'm leaning towards a lazy three fund portfolio (US stocks/international stocks/US bonds). 

I have not yet discussed with my future employer about pre-tax retirement savings such as 401k they offer, but when I do, I intend to max my contribution to that first as well.

My main questions are--

1. Any recommendations on how I should save, or if I should save more?
2. Am I paying too much for rent? I budgeted $3000/month max at first but found a GREAT apartment for $3500- is that feasible? 
3. Any other advice or recommendations in terms of spending on any of these categories? Do y'all have any rules of thumb to follow/live by, now that I'm about to enter a much higher earning potential and start my career?

That debt was a loan at 18.45% with a $1018 monthly payment. I was two years into a three year plan to pay it off.

I know conventional wisdom says you should have a big emergency fund for these times especially when you’re an impacted industry (my emergency fund was at $12k as I paid off debt), but I did math and realized that the emergency fund would probably end up going toward this monthly payment, so why not just pay it off, save $1000 in interest, and be rid of that $1018 monthly payment for good?

I paid off the $10,682 and it felt great but the next morning I’m freaked out that my $1000 emergency fund is too small.

I feel like Dave Ramsey would be happy with me but Suze Orman would be furious!

I still have debt to repay ($885 per month loan at 16.45%, $18562 to go and $158 per month student loan at 5.35%, $2043 to go) but I think I’m going to take a breather and pay the minimums for a few months as I funnel extra money away.

I let debt ruin my life for too long and I got in too deep, but now I’m trying to knock that out however I can. Do you think I did the right thing?",Was paying off my debt a mistake?

In other words, we have more than enough for an emergency fund. We are trying to figure out a solid path forward to putting our money to work to make us more financially independent. 

**Goals:**

Begin investing in a total market fund (FSKAX) to better put our money to work, continue to do this long term in other to give us financial security. Maybe early retirement? 

**Here is the situation:**

We are using Fidelity due to existing account and ease, so no Vanguard

Relatively LCOL Area

Ongoing costs for an active post-graduate program, like $6,000 for the next year or two

Roth's Max out

401K Maxed out 

No children (yet)

In our early 30's

At some point we want to buy a new house, we believe our current home has enough equity to cover most of a down payment on a new house, so that is not a huge concern. 

**Debt/On-going Cost:**

Not CC Debit or Student Loans 

One car paid off (yay), one has about $8,000 left on the loan (0.9%)

Mortgage remaining balance $90,000 (2.75% on a 15 year loan - we are about 5 years in)

About 4k per year in medical expense 

Reasonable costs for food, home maintenance, etc.

**Savings:**

\~$130k at 1.25%

**Questions:**

We are thinking about starting at 1k a month to invest, does this make sense and is it aggressive enough given our current savings? I think we could probably afford this WITHOUT having to tap into the saving account.

Thoughts on FSKAS vs. other funds in terms of taxes and other factors, I would prefer a single fund. I prefer a mutal fund vs ETF because I can more easily automate most of the investing.

Now, I’m 18 years old living in Chicago and, over last 2-3 years, I’ve saved up $13k. I don’t know what to do with it. Any suggestions?

Here are a few things about me to consider before replying:
-I’m currently saving about $2,400 a month and will be able to continue this until fall.
-When I return to university this fall I’ll have a job waiting for me, a shift manager position at a small ice cream shop near campus. $15/hr, I believe.
-I’m on a full ride at my university so I will graduate without debt. 
-I dont plan to master in anything unless I get a job that offers tuition reimbursement.
-No car debt. When my dad realized I got a full ride, he agreed to use his savings for my college to buy me a car outright. My mom pays the insurance (I may pick up this bill, but she says I don’t have to).
-I have one credit card but no consumer debt because I pay the balance the day it comes through. I’m using this card to build my credit score, which sits at about 710 last I checked.
-I have a roth IRA that I’m contributing to monthly. About $100-$200. I’m not yet ready to max it out because of the volatility in the market right now. I may plunge more money in if the market tanks like everybody thinks it will. 
-I’ve heard a lot about 3-6 month worth of expenses but I can’t really figure those numbers out for myself because my only real bill is Spotify. When I’m not at uni, I live rent free with my parents (they usually cover food costs too, since I clean the house). When i’m not with my parents, I dorm for free at uni with a meal plan. This means I don’t really HAVE expenses. I probably won’t have any for the next three years.

personalfinance,"So, after being roped into a IUL by a financial advisor at the beginning of the year, I've now come to realize this was a mistake and that there a smarter ways in which I should be planning for my future. I'd like to cancel this thing now while its still early enough to do so. However, for the life of me I cant find the following information anywhere online or through my account portal at the provider's website (it requires two factor authentication and for some reason I never receive the text with the code so I can't even log in):

The IUL has a surrender charge of $3,428.72 during the first year. So far, I've made five 300 monthly payments for a total of $1,500. I see losing the $1,500 as a lesson learned in not doing proper research before getting a financial product so I'm at peace with taking that hit. However, what I'm not sure about is if I cancel now, will I end up OWING them an additional $1,928.72 (the difference between the surrender charge and the total of my monthly payments)?

personalfinance,"I'm enrolling in my new employer's 401(k) plan. The options are not great but I'm not leaving matching money on the table. There are basically two schools of thought I'm encountering from talking to friends in the finance field. 

1. Managed funds have much higher costs than index funds, and research indicates don't significantly outperform an index fund over the long term anyway. Therefore, investing in these funds is just throwing your money away due to the higher expense fees.
2. Looking at historical 3-, 5-, and 10-year average annual returns should trump concerns about cost unless the costs are unreasonably high (over 1%) or the performance is roughly the same as an index.

I'm looking for additional input here. I don't want to bleed money with higher expenses, but I also don't want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. I'm happy to spend $1 to make $2.

My plan right now is 10% in each of Fund 1 and Fund 2, but Fund 2, which is an index, has lost money over its lifetime... so even though it has a much lower expense ratio, part of me wonders if I should just put it all in Fund 1.

personalfinance,"I’ve been posting on this sub a lot the past week (this will be the third post) but you all have been so helpful and I really appreciate everyone’s perspective and advice.

TLDR: I was fired but my company allowed me to sign something saying I mutually resigned.  Should I say I was left my previous employer because of a “mutual resignation” or “involuntary termination”?  I have to consider what sounds better to my next employer but also have to consider if/when I file for unemployment.

Northern Virginia (NoVA).  was let go of my job on 5/15 for what they say is poor performance but I think it’s them trying to put someone with more experience in my place although I didn’t quite challenge it because I was so unhappy at this job.  They’re offering me a severance package which is a month and a half of unemployment plus all my annual leave which would be a little more than what I could get out of unemployment for that same time period.  However, in the severance agreement I will have to sign off on that I left as a “mutually agreed resignation.” “Resignation” sounds like I could put me in a tight spot when it comes to filing for unemployment benefits after the severance runs out but my ex-employer said they would not deny any unemployment claims.

I asked this sub and most of you seemed to say that I should be fine to accept the severance package under the current terms of the agreement (saying I resigned) and still collect unemployment.  I also consulted with an employment lawyer through my county’s lawyer referral service (which I would suggest anybody to use as it was only a $40 consulting fee) who also stated that I should be fine to accept the terms as is and still file for unemployment without issue.  However, I went through the same services to get a second opinion and consulted with an unemployment benefits lawyer who said that I should ask my work if they would agreeable to change the language on the document to say “terminated” instead of “mutual resignation” since that would be less problematic for me if I try to claim unemployment and if my ex-employer said they’re not going to deny my unemployment claim anyway then why not change it on the document to say “terminated” unless they had ulterior motives.  He also added that even if they don’t agree to change the wording that I should still be fine to sign off on the agreement as is.

I went back to my work and asked if they would change the wording from “mutual resignation” to “terminated” and they said they would be agreeable to change it to “involuntary termination”.  If they’re agreeable to change the wording for my unemployment claims and have also stated that they would not challenge my unemployment claims and a majority consensus  (including 2 lawyers) say that I can accept the severance agreement as is (“mutual resignation”) and still claim unemployment then should I just sign the severance agreement as is saying that it was a “mutual resignation” or ask my ex-employer to change the wording?  I’m just thinking how it would sound to future employers but similarly I want to also think about collecting unemployment when I need to.

personalfinance,"I am planning to start grad school on June 29th, the total cost of the program over 1.5-2 years is about 17k. 

- I currently owe 15,400 that are all direct subsidized loans and it is showing my first payment as due December 2021. 

If rates are dropping on July first, should I try to pay for my first semester out of pocket rather than paying towards my undergrad debt immediately? And then take out the loans needed afterwards? I have about 11 months worth of savings which equals about 13k total savings/checking. 

I have minimized most of my expenses and am in the process of refinancing my house to save my wife and I another $120 a month total.

personalfinance,"Hi,

I am in a situation where I had previously decided to pay my mortgage on my apartment as fast as possible for the following reasons:

* I wanted to be able to take out another mortgage for a house within the next 5 years (with plans to possibly raise a family etc.) since my apartment is not big enough to raise a family. I don't plan to start a family soon, but it is something I want to plan for.
* I wanted to be debt free personally so if I decide to start a business or invest money, I would free to do so and put all my savings towards it without the fear ending up homeless.

My plan for 2020 was to pay off my mortgage with as many early payments as possible, and by my calculation, this would have been possible by 2021. This goes contrary to the advice of many people since it was ""good"" debt, but it felt more stable just to pay it off and move on with my life.

Then Coronavirus hit:

* Property and rental prices are down. If I do own my property 100%, it has less value in the short-term. Something tells me it doesn't make sense to pay it all off in this uncertain time.
* Banks are likely to slash interest rates (meaning I lose nothing if I pay my mortgage later)
* Starting a business may not prove as straightforward as it seems. Some people say it's even more ideal, but I am not sure.

My question is, would it make more sense to aggressively invest into the stock market (or another similar property) and delay my plans of paying off my current mortgage? 

During uncertain times, I feel like the safe option would be just to pay off the mortgage anyway, but I feel like I might be missing out on the right opportunity to invest too.

personalfinance,"My long time girlfriend and I live in central london. We are from a different country, have lived here 2 years and only plan on being here a few more (plan to move home before we start a family). We have a lot of disposable income, and are thinking of buying an irresponsible car to enjoy now before we settle down in a few years (have children, and move back home where cars are significantly more expensive). 

Situation: 28 and 26 years old. I make a little over 150k gbp per year (about half base half bonus) and she makes about 75k. Our flat costs 2500 per month in rent and aside from this we have very few expenses so we are left with significant leftover income. I have saved enough for a about half the cost of a nice home in my country and continue to put money towards this. We have significant upside salary potential in the near term in both of our occupations while we remain in London but this will stall when we move home. 

We are thinking of buying a used (roughly 5 years old) porsche cayman for about 25-30k. 

Reasons in support:
-cars here are half the price compared to in my home country, in a few years we will have children and definitely wont be able to justify a 2 seat car, so if there is a time to purchase and enjoy enjoy a sporty car now seems to be the time. 
-given the economic climate, we may get a good price in the next few months. 
-we have currently been hiring a car to explore on the weekend (although admittedly hiring is still a cheaper option).
- While I was in university I had a huge poster of the original porsche cayman on my wall above where I studied, so buying it has some meaning to me as well, almost a reward for the hard work over the past years.

Reasons against:
- we dont NEED it
- we both walk to work so it will only be for the weekends
- added expenses such as parking space, insurance 
- can afford it, but this money could otherwise be saved. 

All the ways I look at it it seems we can easily afford it, but I did not grow up with money so I still struggle to comprehend spending that much money on a car.

I put the money I made in crypto right back in, and well, it's going on a 3 year bear market just about. At first at age 27 I really didn't have that much money to throw in, luckily.  I had just finished school so I was close to broke. But in very early 2018, I landed a job, salary at the time was about 40k. I been there for 2 years now and I made about 75k this past year.

I was buying the dips to the dips, I swung traded here and there and bought in cheaper at times all just for the prices to dip even further. I'm actually down 30% still.

It's been a little bit over 2 years, but I can't seem to stop. This one crypto called XDC just made me 6x, but I'm soo emotionally attached on the idea ""Long term investment"" that I can't sell.

personalfinance,"Hi, I am a mother and I'm trying to convince my daughter (only 23 years old) that it is a bad decision for my daughter and her boyfriend to purchase an apartment with their current financial situation and I'm worried to death but I just can't seem to get through to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Property price, $500000

25% down = 125000

The interest for the mortgaged amount is at 4.75% ARM (Due to bad credit score from her boyfriend, my daughter is in the 7xx)

Both my daughter and her boyfriend have nothing saved up for downpayment, as a result they've convinced a relative from the guy's side to take out a second mortgage loan to lend them as downpayment.

2nd mortgage loan = 170,000 to cover 25% down and other fees and furniture. This loan has an interest rate of 9.0%

&amp;#x200B;

They have an after tax income combined, 10000 per month.

As they each already have a car payment, so I had her list out all the expenses and food etc.

The expense each month is 8500. (This includes $1275 interest to the 170,000 loan at 9.0%, but does not include any repayment to the principle on the 170,000 loan)

&amp;#x200B;

So their net positive monthly income is 1500.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, I'm not sure how they can ever repay the 170,000 2nd mortgage loan at 9.0%.

Her reply to me was, the apartment would raise for sure and in a few years they could re-finance it and some how repay the 170,000. 

I'm trying to tell her to rent if she wants, but she thinks renting would cost her same amount of money anyways, so why throw money away that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really skeptical of them being able to handle this as her bf is the type of people who overspends and actually his networth right now is -5700. (He owes credit card debt...) and they think this is perfectly fine ?!

They think I am old schooled and worry too much. (I already told them lots of What Ifs like, what if either of them lose their jobs due to bad economy, what if they break up\])

They think everybody use debt to buy properties in Vancouver, or else there are no way they could have saved enough money

I personally don't think it is too late for them to start saving up for downpayment. They both are still living at home with parents. No one is kicking them out. 

&amp;#x200B;

They said they will just sell the place if things don't work out and they are assuming the property will go up 2-3% per year so even if they end up breaking up and having to sell the place in a few years they will still gain something or break even worse case scenerio.",Using a 2nd mortgage from a relative to pay for downpayment

It's actually really not that much money, and we end up buying groceries out of pocket for 70% of the month.

The reality is, our state sucks. If it wasn't for her ability to work and make decent money while bringing the baby to work (she's a nanny for doctors) than we'd probably just move to a different state and do just fine. But this is where we're at, at least for the next year or so.

I am really not sure how much of a lease finance charge (factor) is built up into my monthly payments. It has 50,000 miles now. There have been times where I delayed regular maintenance on this car but nothing drastic. Beside that the car is in good running condition. As of now the payoff is $11,400.  KBB is also around same number. Should I just go ahead and finance it or perhaps maybe switch to some other cheaper car? The goal here is to find out if it is worth to spend $11,400 on a 2016 Camry. I don’t really care about what kind of drive I have if that helps. Lastly, I have this much cash available but have TONS of credit card debt which is mostly on zero interest for a year.  Should I pay cash and save on interest and then work on paying my credit card debt? I do see cash inflow in future to cover my credit card debt in time.

Thanks!!!",Should I buy my leased car?

In the meantime, would I be allowed to refinance as a primary home, or would I have to immediately indicate that I plan on renting it out as soon as NYC opens back up? If the latter, it doesn't make sense for me to refinance since investment property rates are higher than my current rate.

personalfinance,"Hello all! I am looking for some advice for girlfriend and her current situation. A little about her finances... She is 30 years old.

Current income - $136,500

Debt - $73,000 in student loans recent refinanced to an interest rate of 3.9% (Private loan). She pays $1000 a month on this however her minimum is closer to around $700.

Retirement - Contributes 5% to her 401k and her work contributes 4%. The present value of her 401k is $11,000. She also currently maxes out her Roth at $6,000 a year with the present value of her Roth at $23,000. She will be doing the backdoor Roth this year.  Her allocation is 100% stocks in her Roth and HSA right now. We both got a late start on retirement savings due to our schooling and are really trying to buckle down and get our finances in order.

Emergency fund - $10,000 in a high yield saving account with Goldman Sachs 1.3% interest.

She signed up for an HSA through her work and is on track to contribute $3,500 this year. Her account is with HSA bank and she moves the funds to TDameritrade where she can invest in stocks, ETF, Mutual funds etc... Currently has the money in two ETFs. She is healthy and her only medical expense are yearly check ups. 

Unfortunately, we were both unaware that California does not recognize HSA's. I understand that when she contributes she will still get a federal tax break not a state. It is my also understanding that she will owe taxes on any dividends or capital gains. However, she does not plan on selling any of these assets anytime soon. She is curious if she would be better off increasing her 401k contribution and decreasing her HSA contribution given this tax situation. Of note her 401k is through John Hancock and her she is currently in JFIVX (expense ratio .04) and VOT (Expense ratio 0.13). These were the best funds we felt with lowest expense ratios. She previously was in a John Hancock 2055 target with 100% of her contribution but her new contribution is now only 15% as she wanted to move into the above funds. 

Any advice would be appreciated on if she should continue to max at her HSA or put that money to her 401k. She does really like the idea of  having an account for medical expenses, so even if it may not be the best tax wise that will also weigh into her decision. We also will probably move out of California in 5 years but I am getting loan repayment through my work so we are staying put for the time being.

My husband and I are in California; the trust/estimate is based in Missouri.
Hi  all - my husband and I (both 40) will be requesting a large distribution (or preapproval for distribution) from a trust created by his now-deceased father once it's settled later this year. The money would be towards the purchase of our first home. We make a solid income but our jobs are in a pricey area and our barrier to entry is the down payment.
The trust's priority is ""preservation on the principal"" for another 10 years; we also must prove that my husband is being a ""productive member of society."" 
Here's the thing: my husband's the black sheep of a very dysfunctional family. Anyone outside his immediate family, however, can (and does) see that he and I are about as stable and low-risk in every facet imaginable as a couple can be. We're boring as hell, to be frank. However, as the bank involved with the trust has confirmed, the deceased's girlfriend can nix requests for distributions. Based on our interactions, I believe few things would please her more.  
We will be getting a lawyer to guide us through the  process (this could be a gamechanger like nothing else for our finances; plus we're vastly outgunned otherwise by the GF/bank) but in the meantime, are hoping to get a sample distribution request so we can put all relevant documents/information together.  Advice welcome as well.
Essentially, we want to make our request as airtight as possible so that it's plain as day that refusing us a distribution would be a dick move and nothing else... especially since there's no one to leave the money to (3 beneficiaries, no kids), our target home price is less than the local average, etc.

**I'm looking back on this now, and I am so, so sorry it's so long, I've bolded the important bits.**

Hey, so I am planning on doing the student exchange program with the AFS, specifically from the States to Japan. Only problem... it's around **$16,050 for the full trip**.

**I'm technically old enough to get a job, but unless it is remote, I can't until after the pandemic lets up**, so that I don't put people in danger by working at the grocery store across the street. The trip will be in **March 2022**, so I'll likely get a job before then.

Because I identify as someone who is LGBTQ+ I'll be applying for the LGBT scholarship, and I also will apply for the memorial scholarship. I'm not really banking on either of them because the LGBT one only goes out to four people and I have done nothing of interest, and I've faced basically no hardships apart from the occasional kid saying something stupid, or my homophobic grandparents. The memorial scholarship only goes out to one person, so while I will apply, I'm not really banking on that one either. Basically, I'm likely **not going to get any financial aid or scholarships**.

**My mom is willing to pay for part of the trip**, but the full 16k is way too much for just one parent, (my parents are divorced and my dad doesn't really approve too much of Japan, he'd rather I go to Germany since that is what I'm studying in school, and they speak more English there... which is exactly what I want to avoid lol, I want the full culture shock. Also, at the time where this will happen, I will have filed for my own custody and I'll only be with one parent for personal reasons) so **I need to cover at least half, if not three-quarters of it**. I also need to get my own **spending money**, since that has always been the rule when it comes to these kinds of things, although I'm less worried about that because if I ever run out, AFS still covers food and such so I won't need to worry too much.

I know I could go towards an alternative program, such as rotary, but while I've heard good things about it from the internet, I have anxiety about it, as opposed to AFS, which I have had multiple friends use, and from what I've heard, your input for the destination is considered much more, and my school, in particular, is much closer with the AFS, and they have a specific counselor just to help with exchange type stuff, so I'll be way less paranoid.

I do have some skills which I can utilize to help me save up, but I also need some advice on how to get the most out of it. Personally, I am very artistic. I actually know someone who is thinking of making a children's book, and if she does, she wants me to be her illustrator. The agreement is that if this happens, I will do it for free because she may not even publish it, and I could illustrate thirty or more pages in around thirty hours, which is twice the time I spend on a normal illustration, since I am very comfortable with a cartoon type style. In addition, I have almost no name on the internet, so this would be amazing exposure for me, and if she does publish it, I will get paid a fair amount of the price.

I also customize shoes. I don't have the fancy paints, I just use markers because I'm quite comfortable with it, and I live in a rich area where people buy this kind of stuff all the time. It's a pretty wealthy area, and I know a bunch of people who know people who are always buying custom shoes and other things, so I  do have some connections.

2. Our refrigerator and dishwasher both died during the past month, we planned on buying replacements this weekend ($3k). Will making a big purchase impact our ability to refinance/rate? 

3. How do you compete lenders? I have a Quicken loans rep who is eager to do the hard pull, but I’m worried working with him will limit me to Quicken and that I won’t have someone comparing the best rates.

4. Would you recommend taking out the extra cash for projects?

personalfinance,"On a throwaway account, but my father recently passed away and left my sister and I with about a 200k inheritance each. Around 100k is liquid from bank accounts + life insurance policy, and another 100k will be from a 401k. I need some advice.

Current Stats:

* 28 years old
* Income: 97K in Medium-HCOL area (Connecticut)
* Private Student Loan: 90K @ 4.6%
* Federal Student Loan: 20K currently @ 0% but normally ranges up to 4.55% IIRC
* Car Loan: 7.7K @ 5.29%
* 401K: Contribute 6% no match
* My partner has the mortgage on the house we live in, I contribute $1000 into the house account but that mainly goes to utilities/internet/buffer

Tentative Plan:

1. Consult CPA on tax repercussions of inherited 401k - I'm hoping to not have to take it as a lump sum, and will keep it in a HYSA until I understand how to invest it. 
2. Pay off private student loan and car loan (frees up \~1100 of my monthly cash flow)
3. Bump up 401K contributions to 10%
4. Pay off federal student loan within 2 years (considering the 0% interest rate *could* be extended?)
5. I would also like to help my partner pay off his debt more aggressively. He has \~20K in credit card debt and \~60K in student loans and makes \~150k a year. I would like to use my freed up cash flow to contribute more towards the mortgage/house expenses so he can focus on debt. We would like to have a baby within 1.5-2 years (and plan on getting legally married) and I would like to have his credit card debt paid off before the baby. I think we can pay off his student loans within 5 years, if not sooner.

personalfinance,"Hello, Reddit.

I don't like talking about this, but it's time. My grandfather is 99 and my grandmother 94. They will not be around forever. I will give you the brass tacks because I need help and there is way too much family history to go over.

The biggest part of this story you need to know is that my aunt has power of attorney over my grandparents on my father's side. Both my aunt and my father are extreme alcoholics, resulting in the destruction of my parents' marriage and flared tensions in all directions. My Dad and I have made our peace and are now cordial - friendly, even. I have made it a point to stay in touch with him, regardless of money. But recently, I've been thinking about the wealth my grandparents have and how much greed/entitlement my aunt has over that wealth. She has told my father before that she plans to take everything because she ""has earned it."" In truth, she has been my grandparent's most ardent caretaker, even if she is a constant alcoholic. But now I see why that may be. And why my cousins have felt so distant. I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

Sorry.

My father's response to this is mixed. On one hand, he says he will fight her in probate court on it if it comes to that. On the other, he says ""THINGS don't mean as much when you get older."" The latter is certainly true, but generational wealth is a thing. And I have had to fight tooth and fucking nail to get what I have. Forgive me for feeling a little entitled to what is my father's by birthright. Even if he up and decided to spend it all before it got to me - FINE. At least it was my Dad's and he got his share. He is a shitty person but I love him because he is blood. I am sure some of you can relate to that.

I feel like I'm getting into this game late. I feel like my cousins and my aunt have been setting this field up for some time now. And I feel like my aunt has been enabling my father's alcoholism/smoking to make him complacent. I have failed as a son in that regard. But help me protect what future my father has left - and, of course, my own.

Do I need to start getting a game plan together? Should I contact a lawyer? I can't push for this extremely hard FOR my Dad. I have to make him want to fight for what is his. And that time is coming.",I believe my Aunt plans to take everything after my grandparents die - what can I do?

Vanguard has a list of target retirement funds based on number of years till retirement and your current age. If I go by number of years till retirement, they would recommend a 2035 fund. However, if I go by age, they recommend a 2050 fund. I feel that I am somewhat okay if I have to adjust my retirement age by a few years or work part time, etc... That makes me feel that I should try to be more aggressive with stocks rather than bonds and go for the 2050 fund. Additionally, I have many more years to live so another plus for the 2050 fund.

Some numbers:

* House costs around **$640k** (pending upgrades)
* Accessible savings around **$160k** (70k savings accounts, 50k investment accounts, 40k in stock that's going to vest in the next months)
* Household income around $200k (+- 20k depending on stock value each year)
* Savings outside of the US \~ $40k (more challenging to bring to the US, especially during loan closing)
* 401k is currently at around **$90k**

We did some calculations including one time expenses (fridge, washer, dryer, breaking existing lease, moving costs, closing costs, prepaids/impounds, ...) and estimate that the total costs, including a 20% down payment will lead to **\~$150k** leaving us with only **$10k** emergency funds.

The DTI ratio is probably way less than 30% but it still bothers me that the emergency funds are that low.

Going with a down payment of less than 20% somehow seems to be much more expensive (APR jumps from \~3% to 3.6-4% which is significant for a 500k loan). Plus we likely would have to pay for a PMI.

personalfinance,"tl;dr at bottom

Trying to figure out why these aren't aligning.

My employer contributes $1,000 annually to my HSA - we're paid twice a month, 24 pay periods, and they contribute $41.66 per pay period. So far it makes sense.

Looks like the first deposit to my HSA was made at the end of February, and it was doubled up - they deposited $83.32 at that time, and $41.66 every pay period since. 7 so far for $291.62 YTD employer contributions, with my next coming in a week or so. Carrying on through the rest of the year, that should leave me with 22 pay periods where HSA employer contributions were paid out in 2020, for $916.52 in total employer contributions. Or maybe since we're paid in arrears and that first paycheck I get in 2021 is for work done in 2020 I should count that one more instance of $41.66 towards 2020 too?

In any case, point is, that leaves me with $2633.48 or $2591.82 in individual contributions I can make up to the $3550 right? 

Yet when I go to the site where I choose my HSA elections, it says my ""Sum of employer per pay contributions"" will be $666.66 for 2020, and allows me to make elections for individual contributions up to $2883.34 for 2020. And *that* website shows my YTD employer contributions as $333.29, so I'm assuming they've already process my next paychecks contribution and are counting that too.

It details all my past and future contributions for 2020... but cuts of at 9/30/2020. So that must be where they're getting the $666.66 from... but why? Isn't the HSA contribution cap tied to the calendar year? Would my HSA contributions from October on be counting towards 2021?

personalfinance,"So a while ago I went to an urgent care for a visit and I had a balance on my account with them afterwards. At the time of the visit, I used what I thought was my current insurance plan which was a student health insurance plan through my university. Turns out my university had cancelled that plan and had made a contract with a different provider and they didn't send out an email until a few days later. So to recap:

* Insurance A was used on the day of the visit
* Insurance A coverage had terminated a few days prior to the visit
* Insurance B coverage had began a few days prior to the visit
* I used insurance A instead of insurance B because I wasn't aware of the switch yet
* This happened in 2019; I received statements in the mail for the balance owed over the months but kept pushing it.
* I called the facility's billing department a couple of weeks ago and asked them to transfer my old claim to my current insurance (B) and they did
* They said it takes some time for it to be processed (hasn't been posted to my current insurance claims online)
* I just got a collections notice in the mail

What effects does this have? Is this reported as debt to credit agencies? Should I wait for the claims to transfer first? If my debt has already been sold to a collections agency and the insurance provider makes an adjustment to the medical facility, will the balance be moved back from the collections agency to the medical facility's accounts?

The only carrier I can use it with is Sprint. When I joined Sprint I got their kick starter deal and only pay $31 a month for one line. 

The iPhone 7 will stop getting updates next year so i’m looking to get a new phone. I have two viable options and was hoping you could help me decide.

Right now, Mint Mobile is doing a special until the end of the month where, if I spend $750 I can own an iPhone SE and get their network plan for 2 years. So I would own a new phone that wouldn’t phase out for years and I wouldn’t have to pay a phone bill for two years BUT I am paying $750 in a lump sum. I could also sell my iPhone 7 and pocket that $150 or whatever it ends up being.

The other option is to just buy an upgrade from Sprint. If I spend $100 I can upgrade to an iPhone SE as a lease for 18 months. If I keep sprint, I am spending $720 over the next two years at $30 a month plus the $100 for the upgrade. The only upfront cost is that $100 but I do not own the phone.

My stimulus check really helped bolster my bank account and my expenses have gone down since everything has been shut down (whether you think the shutdown is a good or bad thing should be reserved for another reddit post).

I will be getting a new job at the end of June or the beginning of July that will pay me at least 15% more than I'm the currently making. There is also the opportunity for extremely rapid raises (I could be making 54% more than my current wages by the end of the year). Obviously, it's not smart to act as if I'm making 54% more until I actually am. But my point is that I'll be making significantly more than I am now very soon. This is all in addition to 14 days of unused vacation that will be paid out to me when I leave my current employer. That will likely all go to savings. 

All this being said, there have been some things I've been thinking about doing or purchasing that I feel would benefit me. For example, I'd like to buy a top of the line Sonicare toothbrush. Maybe a Waterpik as well. That's a few hundred bucks. My oral hygiene isn't horrible, but it could use some work. And I would consider this a long term investment in myself and in my health. An ounce of prevention goes a long way.

I've also been thinking about giving myself a monthly book allowance. I haven't read a book all the way through in a very long time and that makes me sad. I'd probably focus on classics to begin with: The Wealth of Nations, Leviathan, Treatises on Government by John Locke and political writings by Rousseau. But I feel that reading anything, even fiction, is beneficial to pretty much everyone.

It has no ticker, i don't see dividends since I've had it (2017) and i called both Fidelity and Vanguard directly and they can't see that the fun gives dividends. 

Growth is of course important to me but if a fund isn't going to offer a dividend it seems pointless. Im worried though because both vanguard large caps don't have a ticket so I can't tell if the other one gives a dividend either. I was thinking about reducing investing in this fun to just 5% and reinvesting in shares in the mid and small cap.

How would you all do it? Sorry for the long post and feel free to ask any follow up questions.

personalfinance,"Hi:

Recently, I was in an accident and the other driver accepted complete fault. Due to COVID, my insurance did a virtual estimate where I had to send them a video and a few pictures of the damage. The damage on the outside was pretty minor. My insurance estimated the damage to be about $1700.

I took my car into the body shop for another estimate. The body shop estimated the complete work to be about $5500. The remaining value on my auto loan is less than $5500. So here is where I need your guidance:

* For reference, my car is 2013 Audi A4 Premium Plus trim
* Remaining loan term about 13 months at $395 per month
* Should I ask the insurance to declare the car ""totaled"" and from the money I receive, fix the car, and pay off the loan?
* I estimate the current value (or cash/book value) to be in the neighborhood of $9,000 to $12,000.

personalfinance,"Hey all, I’m going to start this off by going over the basics. 

My girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) are currently stuck living with her parents for the last 6 months due to the coronavirus outbreak impeding our ability to search for a home/find better jobs. Together, we make about 45k a year after taxes and we are just so sick of renting and would like to own our own place. 

We have a realtor and talked and met with him back in February and he went over the basics and he thinks we could afford anywhere between 60k-120k home which we budgeted for around 50k-100k so that was good. We’ve been saving places online to the online portal our realtor has access to so he can see everything we save or delete. 

We are looking for a small single family home 2 or 3 bedrooms with 1 or 2 baths in the Pittsburgh area (around 20-30min drive to the city). Preferably move-in ready but we have experience with drywall, sanding, painting, etc so we don’t mind that, just no ‘handyman specials’ or ‘investment opportunities’. 

Right now we are both unemployed but receiving unemployment benefits through PUA which is honestly a bit more steady than usual income because we both do gig work on top of our regular jobs. 

Together, we have about 15k saved up for down payment and all other costs like closing and inspections and repairs etc. But we were also told some loan companies provide loans for repairs for FTHB as well which would be great. 

Main struggle is we have gotten prequalified, and we already were denied preapproval by two banks for a home loan. My credit score is 675 and hers is, I think, around 650. 

Now that that info is out there. Is it worth it to keep shopping around for loans/mortgages? I thought we were on the right track to getting pre-approved and buying a home to get out of our shitty situation. Or should we just find a place to rent for now? We originally moved back to her parents house because we wanted to live back in Pittsburgh after moving away for two years, and we’re going to stay until we found a place to rent, but then we started researching buying a home and it sounded very doable as a lot of renters around here already want your income to be 2x-3x the monthly rent. 

I’m pretty frustrated as I read through some posts on here, r/RealEstate, and r/FirtsTimeHomeBuyers and I can’t really relate to them because these are all middle-class people posting their 100k/yr salaries with their 500-600k home budgets. The only thing I’ve really gathered that was helpful is that interest rates are currently pretty low. It would be great to take advantage of that now. 

Any advice/tips/ideas/personal anecdotes are much appreciated. We are just really stuck and need some good news for once.

I first tried the chat channel and was informed I needed to call the 1800 phone number instead to talk with the E-Services team. After confirming there was no other way to submit an IT request and I reluctantly called. 

I called the 1-800 number line - there is no option to be transferred to E-Services team. So I’ll have to wait to talk with a representative and be manually transferred.

I’m not sure why COVID is a surprise on May 23 and can’t be staffed for. I patiently wait and continue to be told to use the website (are they gaslighting me?) and eventually get disconnected after 7 minutes. I try again and fair no better. 

I return the chat and ask if Citibank can call me back. I’m informed this is not a capability of their system. I’m urged to keep on trying, but at this point I’m done.

personalfinance,"tl;dr - Paypal account hacked, someone used my ssn to open a paypal credit account, ordered $1,000+ through paypal &amp; a credit card, has access to my old phone number somehow (changed my number 2 months ago) and is using it to hack into old email addresses &amp; paypal acct. 


Someone has hacked into my paypal account and used my social to open a paypal credit account. They have changed the email address on the account and password and I cannot access it anymore. 

Somehow they are using my old cell phone number to hack my old email address and my paypal account (I changed my phone number 2 months ago and forgot to switch paypal and my old email address because I never use them). 

Before they updated the email for the account, I got several notifications about purchases they’d made in my name, totaling close to $1,000 in an hour. 

Paypal keeps telling me to log into my account but I can’t because they’ve locked me out - and the paypal call centers are currently closed due to Covid so I cannot reach anyone over the phone. 

How do I get PayPal to freeze my account without being able to log in?? I cannot get through to a human at any numbers I’ve called and they have only told me to log into my account and send them a message (I can’t) or to authenticate with my phone number (I can’t bc it’s my old number and I don’t have access to it — nor do I know how this person does??!) 

Does anyone have experience with this? Please let me know! 

And yep I’ve frozen my credit and ordered replacement cards and updated passwords etc, this began yesterday evening at 5pm",Help - Identity Theft / Paypal Fraud!!
personalfinance,"Hi all. In major trouble here and I’m just trying to keep from having a breakdown. To start, credit score is a (yikes) 532. I make $40000 pre taxes a year, no benefits included in my job. My rent is about $1100 a month. I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety (untreated) for a long long time, and I just couldn’t face any of my financial issues. This pandemic has forced me to take responsibility of my finances but I just don’t know where to start. Most of my issues are late payments, which I know will stay on my record until I’m 35 unfortunately. I’m just so lost on what the first step should be to repair and how it would even matter if people searching my credit will see so many late payments for so long.

To start, I have an old EA account that I’ve had since I was a kid and I got a few alerts back in November/December of it being signed into but I hadn’t used it in years. The same thing happened with my eBay account. Not long after that, I got an alert that someone from India tried to log into my personal email. I made a Facebook account purely to join a training group, and then I got an email that there was a suspicious login to my Facebook so FB locked the account. This was only maybe a month after I made it. I’ve gotten phone calls from random numbers that leave messages in what sounds like Chinese. I also got a call (that I answered) of someone trying to tell me my social security number was compromised.

On a recent credit report, there was a notification that my email address had been found on the dark web. I deleted the email address I’ve had since I was a child, which is the address my EA account was associated with. I changed the password to pretty much everything I use today, but now I am getting suspicious texts that contain hyperlinks I’m encouraged to click on, including five in the last few weeks and they typically contain my name.

personalfinance,"Hi All,

The better three-quarters and I are finally on the upward swing after 4 years of living on a grad student + medical resident salary. Current situation:  


\~2 months cash reserves (working up to 3-6)

\~$250k student debt

Mortgage with \~$2500 monthly payment (15 year fixed at 3.25%)

\~$3-5000 left over per month after paying necessary expenses. This will go up in \~2 months after we pay off the last of the personal loan we took out to put a new roof on the house (Realtor told us it was brand new! Inspector said it had \~2 years left. Try 2 months. Grr.)  


We're shopping around for financial advisor help, I have two guys competing at the moment. Likely going to drop the one because he's commission based. The other is fee-based and while I would prefer fee-only, He comes with good references from people I trust. Still contemplating going fee-only. I want an advisor because I'm terrible at this stuff and need the accountability. I'm good at the numbers. But it's obvious at this point that I'll happily ignore them for years as long as the bills get paid. My wife will be very much less stressed about finances if we stop doing that, which will in turn let me play more stress free with the spending money. Win win.  


Anyway. One of the advisors (guess which!) recommended splitting our excess and dedicating a good portion of it to investments vs quick debt paydown. He did some math comparing earnings on an investment to interest paid on a loan that looked really lopsided in favor of investing. I'm not so sure. I can make the math look good either way by tweaking the payoff vs investment ratio, the investment interest rate, etc.  


Is this a common trick those guys use to get you to buy products? Is there a student loan interest rate below which paying the minimum and investing is a ""no-brainer"" or vise versa? There's a certain mental freedom that comes with the idea of being debt free, but at the end of the day debt payoff of this scale is a long haul.

personalfinance,"Hey all,

About a month ago, I contributed 6,000 dollars to traditional IRA for 2019, and then converted it to a roth IRA a week later.

I'm having trouble figuring out the correct way to fill this out on my tax filing software. After doing a good amount of googling, I read that I have to fill out an 8606 form for 2019 that will just tell the IRS that I put in 6,000 dollars towards nondeductible traditional IRA right? And then it will be next year where I will fill out how I converted it to a roth IRA.

I already filed 2019 taxes with H&amp;R block free, so it looks like I have to amend it. I am trying to find a place where  I can put down the $6,000 of nondeductible IRA. This is what I've got so far.

https://imgur.com/a/IwsKoty

For some reason the area to fill out ""non-deductible contribution"" is greyed out, and as you can see at the last picture, it still shows the money in a deductible traditional contribution.

Which would be better overall on your credit report: bankruptcy to wipe out a reposession deficiency for a car,  or settling the deficiency somehow with collections and gradually rebuilding credit?

We have 401ks, 25k in a brokerage account (non-retirement, in index funds), \~$11k in stock in a highly volatile market, and I have tIRA with tens of thousands and a Roth IRA with about 30k that I opened in 2014.

We have a property on the market but it won't get an offer an close before this house, but the equity from it will replenish our cash to close on this new one.

We don't want to sell in a bear market if possible, but if we're short, I think I can sell off some of my Roth IRA at no penalty since it was opened in July 2014 (it's 5+ years old), is that correct?

I never paid anything on my student loans. Taxes have been garnished for them for the last like 8 years. If my credit report is right I only have one left at ~$4000. I got enough back on taxes this year to pay it off (They did not get garnished this year. Either cause covid or cause this one was not part of the garnish. Dunno.) 

The question I have is this. According to creditwise my oldest account is 12 years and seeing as the only other account is a credit card from late 2019 it has gotta be the loan. For improving my score would I be better paying it off or trying to get on payments so as to keep it for a year or two. I will say that month or two back I saw a [250 point jump](https://imgur.com/OBy1Bz0). Fairly sure that had to do with covid doing something to the loan.

I’m confident that my home would sell, and quickly, but I’m not stupid enough to submit an offer with 20% down if I didn’t already have a buyer lined up. I’m not willing to sell and move into a temporary place while house hunting either, but I read that I could potentially set up a bridge loan with my Credit Union (I had never heard of this type of loan before) that would allow me to pay the downpayment, and then pay back the loan with the equity of my home once it sells. 

Is this a normal practice? I have a decent sized savings account (not 50-60k worth) but I’m loath to touch it, even though I’m quite confident my home will sell quickly (you never know what a home inspection will turn up, a market crash, etc.)

$195K balance on the mortgage. It's a 20 year mortgage at 3.5%, we are about 8 years into the mortgage. We also have an $8K balance on a HELOC that was used for emergency roof repairs last year. That is a variable $100K LOC and the current rate is 3.48%.

We are starting the process of planning our renovations. I don't have a final estimate on the cost of the renovations we want done, but we are estimating $150K total.

I'm struggling with how best to finance this. Because of the current state of the house and real estate values in the area, I'd value the house at $400K-$450K or so currently. I think the renovations would put us at the $500K-$550K range (desirable neighborhood, mid range house relative to the neighborhood), but we plan to stay in this house for at least another 15-20 years sp I'm fine with putting the money into it.

I’m on £21.50 an hour so that’s approx £540 a week for my hours worked. I’m always personally in the red on my bank account.

Now I get it, it’s easy to say “just stop playing and buying games” but damn man I’ve been doing it since I was 3 and it’s my favourite pass time. I’ll literally be doing nothing else otherwise and will most likely be depressed if it got to that point.

What I want some advice for is how to save, spend less and get more from life because it seems that all my money goes to my PlayStation and it sucks. Especially with Fifa. If anyone is familiar with how that works, you’ll realise how addicting it is.

personalfinance,Currently I have a Roth IRA. My company introduced 401k in January either as Roth or Traditional. So far I have a few thousand in a Traditional 401k but planning to leave the company soon. Does it make sense to transfer to a Roth 401k now so I can easily roll it over to my Roth IRA when I leave?

personalfinance,"Hoping for a little advice. I’ve been told by several loan officers that cash out refi is extremely difficult at the moment. I have excellent credit. I’ve been given two options, both include buying 1.3 points for 7k total closing costs. 

Option 1: Cash out refi. Reduce current monthly payment by $270/mo

Option 2: Straight refi. Reduce monthly by $500+

personalfinance,"i’m 22, full time college student, part time worker; work around 16 hours a week. i have one student loan for $2750.0. live with my parents and only current expense i have right now is my monthly life insurance payment or a credit card bill that might come up if i use it. 

i got my first card at 18 with a secure line of credit from my bank with some graduation money. worked it into a open line of credit the following year. i also have a home depot card i barely use and pay off right away.

any advice is appreciated.",what’s a good second credit card?
personalfinance,"I'm 22 years old and recently graduated from community college as an x-ray technician and make ~$45k/yr at my first real job. I live in a somewhat high COL area (big city &gt; 1 million people). 

I've been told by my parents to start saving aggressively for retirement as early as possible, so I set up my 401k to deduct 10% of my paycheck. I also pay around $100/mo for a high deductible health plan and also put $50 out of every paycheck into my HSA account (I know that's low but I rarely go to the doctor). 

My total net take home pay comes out to about $1,100 every 2 weeks. 

I've tried to stay as frugal as I possibly can. I drive a used car from 2004 that I own outright (no payments). However, between car insurance and gas I spend about $300/mo. I have shopped around, I cannot find car insurance for less than $180/mo (apparently my city has the highest car insurance rates in the country). 

I have a small amount of student debt (about $4k) and I pay $150/mo towards this.

I live with my parents and pay them $500/mo for rent. I also do my own grocery shopping etc. as I want to practice being independent. In total, including groceries, eating out, toiletries (TP, shampoo, etc.) I probably spend about $4-500/mo but never actually counted every little thing. My phone bill is $50/mo. 

So, as of right now as I'm living with my parents I'm bringing in $2,200/mo and spending about $1,500, leaving me with $700 of ""disposable"" income which I currently try to save (I have about $3k cash savings) and spend on hobbies like video games. 

I'm looking at apartments and I'm seeing around $1k/mo (plus utilities) for a basic 1 bedroom in a relatively low crime area of the city. 

So my budget would look like this:

Rent + utilities: $1200 (?)
Phone bill: $50
Car: $300
Groceries, food, toiletries: $500
Student loan: $150 

total: $2,150
Income: $2,200

So I'd have $50/mo in discretionary spending. It just doesn't seem possible. My car also has 210k miles on it, so I expect that buying a new car will be likely within the next few years. So I'd have a car payment + my insurance will be much higher (I currently only have liability). A ""new"" to me (probably 5 year old) car will cost me $600+/mo between insurance and payments. 

I have a good relationship with my parents, so me moving out to live with roommates is pointless, I'd rather just stay living with my parents rather than some strangers. I've just been looking at moving out because living with my parents forever isn't ideal, especially when I marry and have kids I can't still be living with my parents. 

I don't see a large increase in earning potential outside of the annual 3-4% COL raise at my job. X-ray technician is basically a terminal career, which I chose because I didn't want to go into massive amounts of college debt. To make more money I would have to go back to school and start over completely.",Can I afford to move out?

personalfinance,"Me and my girlfriend want to move out of our current house and lease/rent it out. Our plans is to use that to pay for the monthly mortgage. We are able to do this because our house value went up by 40% since purchasing a few years ago. We still have 25 years left on this mortgage 

We want to move to Cali and houses there cost 500k and onward. 

My girlfriend and I combined income is 130k.

I see there are some first time buyer incentives but obviously we are not first time. We don't have enough save up for a 20 or even 10% down-payment.

We was looking at renting a place but the houses we want to live in cost about 2500 rent a month. I estimated it would cost around the same if we get a mortgage (500-600k) instead, but the problem is the down-payment. 

Are there any tips or advice you can give me ?

personalfinance,"Right now I work full time for my fathers company. I’m fortunate and don’t have to go to school. I like what I do. When I graduated I did not want to go to college so it worked out. Part of the problem was I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I was thinking about going into a skilled trade before I knew I could become full time where I’m at now but I wasn’t really sure if I’d like it. I just didn’t want to go back to school. I am currently 18 and graduated high school last year (Class of 2019) so I basically skipped the first year of college. 

I realized I am interested in finance. I’m always looking things up about it and studying it just because I think it’s good to know. But I’m entertained by it and I want to know a ton about it. Economics, money management, investing, etc. Now I am considering going to college. I really hate school and the first year or two that has nothing to do with my degree will suck. It will be at a cheap community college if I do it though. I barely slipped by some classes my junior and senior year of high school. I never failed a class and knew I never would. Once I knew I’d be either going to a community college or not going at all I knew it would be pointless to work hard in high school. I’d like to think I’m at least somewhat smart but school was so damn boring I didn’t try hard at all. I graduated with a 2.7 GPA I believe. 

The thing I have to figure out is if college is really worth it. I do not want to get a general degree that I won’t use for something specific. I will not go to a 4 year university for all 4 years. I know I don’t have to go to a nice fancy state school for the last two years either. Does anyone here have a degree related to my interests? If you do what do you do now and what options do I have? Before I graduated high school and kind of just assumed I would go to college I was going to get a business degree. After further research I discovered a lot of people go into that because they don’t know what to do and end up getting a job that’s basic and it’s a waste. I didn’t know what I wanted to do and wanted to go into that so it made sense lol. Also, I think people assume business = money when that’s just not necessarily true. I knew that too. So that situation is what I would want to avoid here. If I go it needs to be something that I need to get specific jobs and not to get the same regular old low/normal income job I could get with a random basic degree or no degree. 

One last thing to add is I get some sort of bad feeling working my my father. It’s not like it’s my fault that I have a good opportunity and was born to someone who would eventually start a business. I just get a feeling maybe I should take my own path. I still live with my parents and don’t ask for much anymore so it’s not really that I feel like I’m taking advantage. I guess it might be more my gut. I’m against college when it’s basic things, but not for more specific interests. That is the main thing it comes down to.",Highly Considering College After Deciding Not To Go

He is also, despite owning a business the majority of his adult life, not the most savvy and has others figure out his finances.  So figuring all of this out has been a bit of a struggle.  This weekend will be the first weekly certification so I asked my dad to gather up all his business invoices and expense receipts etc.  What he gave me in terms of expenses was literally every bill he pays for the month so I’m trying to pick out what can be used and what can’t.  

For example - when I asked about him including his mortgage he said 1/5 of his house is considered used for business.  So in this sense is 1/5 of the mortgage considered a business expense?  And if that’s the case can things like utilities be considered business expenses?  The landscaping bill for weekly lawn cutting?  The sewer and sewer tax bills?  If so would I have to calculate 1/5 of the bill or how does that work??  And how about health insurance?  He pays privately for that - is that considered a related or unrelated expense?  He has three vehicles - 2 for work and 1 for personal use.  I believe all 3 may be lumped together into one insurance policy but I have to clarify with him.  If he uses his personal car to even drive to one job estimate, can that be included as a business vehicle?

This is on top of what remained of my principle amount.

My house is in desperate need of repairs, some quite costly. Is it possible to refinance the main principle loan and not the balloon payment, which was a government loan? Or would I have to include both in a refinance?

My thoughts were to refinance with an additional amount for repairs - but it most likely won’t work if need to include the entire amount.

personalfinance,"My company downgraded my bonus grade days before filing chapter 11 bankruptcy. From what I'm being told via my direct supervisor it was at the error of HR who believed I was incorrectly in my bonus group due to a misunderstanding why my bonus was changed few months ago (truthfully it was incorrectly entered a long time ago and only rectified AFTER my first bonus last year. I do not know if this happened to others within the company, but as far as I know, no one else in my group was affected.

After discussing with my supervisor and with his boss (manager) it has been recognized as an incorrect assignment and they have informed me that they are attempting to get this rectified. I am posting this now to inquire on what I can, if anything, do? While I haven't been laid off yet, I am worried layoffs may be coming for my location. They seem likely in any case.

I am unsure on my entitelment to the additional bonus since it was changed without my knowledge and days prior to filing. I obviously would not be entitled to anything if I were laid off since it was a bonus and not necessarily income owed BUT since I am still employed and am not laid off yet (nor do I know if I would be) I am wondering how I should approach my supervisor/manager to expedite things where/if possible? I still have not directly contacted HR regarding this issue or if this can be possibly rectified. Should I leave it in the hands of those above me since they may have more tact/power to cause change or do I take this into my own hands since this is, in fact, my money they are messing with?

The next suggestion was that I have to go to the IRS website and get the AGI that's on my return transcript. To do this I had to make an IRS account. The only item I have, that qualifies for one of the requirements of making an account, is my credit card. The IRS website told me that my information does not match their records; I could not make an account.

The remedy to this, I was told, was I had to get my transcript by mail, which I could do by calling the IRS phone number. I called the IRS phone number. The message I was given was that due to budget cuts they no longer have live assistance and that I should go back to their website to access my account.

personalfinance,"Background: 

I grew up in a relatively well off family of business owners, I never had chores, my mom hired a cleaner to clean the house and wash and fold our clothes and a gardener to tend to the landscaping. 

Problem 

Recently I asked my mom for financial advice, and her advice is based off of the fact she has no set salary and has a constant inflow of money from her businesses and has a net worth of 2.4 million... so her advice is based off of cash flow. 

At this point in my life (28y) I was never taught how to manage money on a set salary and was taught look at things like “well if this table costs $10,000 let’s buy it cash I’ll make this back in a week or two” as a result I am unable to afford the lifestyle I had growing up. 

I’m constantly terrified of running out of money even though I took it upon myself to set a budget. But every month it doesn’t feel like enough and in the current state of the economy i know i can’t move or get a new job, there has been a few lay offs in my industry and no one is hiring. I don’t feel comfortable asking my mom for money, I’m an adult and should be able to handle it... but some months it just feels like to much. See my budget below 

Monthly salary is $3100 after taxes and deductions 


Rent - $1045 
Internet - $75 
Electricity - $65
Cellphone - $85 
Saving deposit $60 
New phone savings $190 (I know I need a new phone. The tech said nothing more can be done. It’s an iPhone 5 and I don’t want to buy a new one on a monthly payment so I’m saving this till December) 
Car payments: $280 
Insurance: $190 (mom is taking care of this for the remainder of the year (after our convo about how I feel like if I’m struggling and I’m using it to save up for a new phone) 
Student loan $220
Line of credit minimum: $80 
Other loans: $330 (mom is taking care of this after our recent convo, But I still include it, this month is the final payment I make until she takes over paying for it next month, they are due to be paid off by April next year)
Gas: $200 (now we are working from home it’s $50, but I still include it because we have to go back at some point... and I’d hate to be caught in the middle of the month without enough money for gas to commute if they announce it) 
Gym - $28 
Netflix - $14 
Groceries $120 
Flex - $160 

Total expenses: $2852 
Remaining: $280

I’m 27 &amp; still living at home to knock down my student loans. In the past 30 months, I’ve paid off $39k between two loans. I have one loan left, with a balance of $31k at 4.9% interest annually. It’s a private loan through a local bank branch &amp; I think it’s technically a “personal loan,” if that, for whatever reason, has any bearing on the situation. My parents co-signed the loan with their house as collateral. 

Living at home is driving me nuts and I’m stuck between deciding if I should continue to get myself in a better spot financially or move out/have more freedom and make smaller loan payments. 

My minimum monthly payment is $350, but My payments are averaging out to $1,500/mo. I’m in a LCOL area but I currently make $20/hr., so moving out will require me to make the minimum payment for the time being, unless refinancing would be beneficial. 

I currently have $11k in savings. I’ve been saving up a bit in case I do decide to move out but, at the same time, I could make a ~$8k payment right now and knock two more years worth of payments on the loan.

I am getting ready to purchase a home again and thought it would be useful to have a spreadsheet version of the New York Times Rent vs Buy calculator - so I created one.

The spreadsheet uses the same calculations as the NY Times version, with a few minor differences. 

* The spreadsheet version allows direct entry of the rent numbers instead of providing a break-even rent number.

* The spreadsheet takes the maintenance costs and splits it into maintenance and renovation costs.

With the spreadsheet, multiple scenarios can be compared by creating new sheets and using different parameter values.

I grew up lower middle class and have always stressed about money until the last few years.  And I mean really stressed about money.

I used to see it as some game/obsession to save the maximum amount of money.  It got to the point where I realized how foolish I was being.  Between my 401k (19.5k), backdoor ira (6k), and my employers 401k match (5k), I had to pull my head out of my butt and realize that I was saving more for retirement each year than a large subset of the country makes in a year (let alone the world).

How much do I really need?  I’m a frugal guy anyway.  What was I trying to do, save 10m. For what?  I always joke with my friends that if it wasn’t for my wife and kids, I bet I could live a completely satisfied life on 25k a year.  I just have a minimalist mindset by nature.

My changes:
- I have significantly increased my donations to both organizations (my church and adoption agencies) in addition to helping people who are hit by tragedies.  If someone truly needs help, I’ll give with ease now.  I don’t worry about how I could have saved it. 

- I don’t get on my wife for spending money nearly as much.  She has great intentions and is responsible.  Her tolerance for spending is just higher than mine.  I’ve had to let go a bit.  I love my wife and don’t want her to feel trapped by my mental problems.  I try to set budgets WITH her and then let her do whatever she wants without judgement.  Why argue with the one you live over money.  Just work together to set a budget and let go.

- I realize how fortunate I am.  I don’t worry about saving nearly as much. Sure saving is important, but you can’t kill yourself with stress.  I save what i can and enjoy life.  I live in the best country in the world, have an education and decent skill set.  Why stress over losing a job.  I bet I could find a job quickly.  It’s like my mind is trying to keep me down for the sake of security.

At the end of the day, a lot of us (on this sub in particular) are extremely fortunate.  Recognize that, save, but be reasonable and help others.  A life of hoarding money and being selfish sucks.

* Only dividend stocks provide the compound interest like effect via DRIP. How would I replicate this with stocks or an ETF that doesn't pay out dividends.

* Income that is 3x the rent
* Offering to pay the lease in full up front

They said **no** due to my ""poor credit"" (only student loans, I'm working on it)  despite everything they still said...""No""

So he talked to them and they said he can sublease it to me, as long as they get a copy. Now...he wants the 7 months up front. Now I was okay giving it directly to the landlord but I'm not sure about hanging 7K to a 23 year old (I'm 30) yes he'll remain on the lease. But what happens if I wake up after a week, and everyone's gone, and the landlord says they were back rent, etc. and I get evicted? Our state has an Eviction Ban, but it can be lifted anytime.

Or what if I pay up front and he never pays, think about it, he has $7,000 cash, the roommates all move out (they split the money) the landlord can't come after them until the bans gets lifted, the courts are all backed up, they'll never catch him...am I overthinking it? Perhaps. And if I get evicted say, after 2-3 months he keeps the rest (plus security - I agreed to pay that up front as well).

I'm accepting 100% of the risk by paying up front, correct?

personalfinance,"My company downgraded my bonus grade days before filing chapter 11 bankruptcy. The downgrade took my bonus down \~5k.  From what I'm being told via my direct supervisor it was at the error of HR who believed I was incorrectly in my bonus group due to a misunderstanding why my bonus was changed few months ago (truthfully it was incorrectly entered a long time ago and only rectified AFTER my first bonus last year. I do not know if this happened to others within the company, but as far as I know, no one else in my group was affected.

I am posting this now to inquire on what I can, if anything, do? While I haven't been laid off yet, I am worried layoffs may be coming for my location. They seem likely in any case.

I am unsure on my entitelment to the additional bonus since it was changed without my knowledge and days prior to filing. I obviously would not be entitled to anything if I were laid off since it was a bonus and not necessarily income owed BUT since I am still employed and am not laid off yet (nor do I know if I would be) I am wondering how I should approach my supervisor/manager to expedite things where/if possible?

personalfinance,"Hey everyone, I’m in a crappy situation in trying to get my mortgage. 

For starters, I changed jobs. I was in the process of changing before I started trying to buy a house, didn’t think I would be buying a house, and wasn’t planning on it until I found a house I loved, at an absolute steal, in an excellent neighborhood with really good potential return. So I understand how you’re not supposed to change jobs prior to buying a house I don’t need to hear it over and over again. 

Now the issue. The new job I am in is a travel nurse job. Travel nurses usually get paid a low hourly rate and get a tax-free stipend as long as you’re duplicating expenses, which I am. My new job is paying double what my old job is. I sent my first paystub of the new job yesterday and the loan officer gets back to me right when they’re closing to tell me “hey since your income isn’t taxed we can’t work with it” despite my sending my offer letter over, telling him multiple times over the phone it wasn’t taxed, and literally emailing him a pay breakdown, all of which he ran by the underwriter and they said it was okay. 

The loan officer wouldn’t really answer any questions as to why they wouldn’t accept it when I asked for specifics since they knew all of this beforehand. The LO told me that they’d give me a call on Tuesday to get this figured out and where to go from here...

So my question is why won’t they accept it? I’ve got a really low DTI, my payment is less than 25% of my net income, and I’ve got all my ducks in a row otherwise (781 credit score). I don’t know if the LO/underwriter thinks at the end of the year I’ll need to pay taxes on the stipend? Or the fact my W2 won’t show much money made this past year (despite them having my stubs)? 

I can delve into specifics if need be, but my biggest thing is they tell me two business days before closing it’s not going to work despite me literally laying out exactly what my check shows.

personalfinance,"Hey guys, I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.

For the past 5 months I've been saving up to get myself out of this auto loan that I currently have.

August of 2018 I walked of my local dealership with a 19k loan at 17% for 84 months. At the time, I really didn't know just how fucking terrible of a situation I just got myself in. The past 8 months I've been working a TON of overtime to tip the scales in my favor. As of today the pay off amount is $10000. I've been saving a LOT of money to try and ""recover"" from this and get myself out of debt with this loan. (More than 85% of my biweekly check goes to this loan, can't wait to pay it off) 

I've managed to save $7400. My plan is to dump every penny of that into what's left of the 10k payoff amount. My question is after that is all said and done should I refinance my loan? With the ridiculously high interest rate and the other variables, my minimum monthly payment is roughly $380. With owing less than 3k on this loan, is it worth it to refinance?

I'd like to dial back a fair bit on how much money I'm pumping into this, maybe instead of 2k every month I'll do 1k. That'd mean I'd have 2.5 months or so left of this loan. Should I just keep the loan and not have another loan under my name?",Should I refinance my loan?
personalfinance,"So I been looking at refinance rates and so far 15 year terms are looking good.

Obviously I know my principal is low and interest ratio is high

The 15 year deal is coming at 3.25% and with it I'm willing to do a $20,000 payment to the principal to bring the loan closer to $137,000 and from the quote I'm getting I'll be at a $1528 payment. But with a $4400 closing cost. Which I'll pay up front as well. This will also get rid of my PMI

Now is it worth going the route of refinancing or am I better off doing a $25,000 principal payment and bring the total down and also removes my PMI making my monthly lower. 

I do want to pay less interest over time if possible but I'm confused whether it's worth the closing cost and increased monthly. I know my principal will increase and my interest will drop with the 15yr. Will that be possible for the 30yrs if I do the lump sum payment?",15 year Refinance rate or stay
personalfinance,"I am at a loss right now. I paid for debt directly to the company( cable/ phone type)  I owed in April of this year 2020. This debt was over a year old and had been sent to collections once. When I originally tried to pay the debt I contacted collections agency A. They informed me that they sold the debt back to company in question. I then paid a 50.00 payment to company when I figured out and found the information to do so this was late Feb 2020. I then paid in full on April 17 2020 to said company. This was only 625 but still enough to  effect me. I then received notice from collections agency B for 625 on my credit report.

I recently moved from California to North Carolina in February to move in with my partner whom I was in a LDR with. I’m still working for my California employer, and we are currently in Open Enrollment for new health plans. I’ve decided to add my partner to my dental insurance plan, but I’m having some issues trying to understand what all that entails.

North Carolina does not legally recognize any type of domestic partnership, and I’m not sure if NC or CA laws are relevant here. My HR company claims that we meet all of the eligibility requirements of being in a domestic partnership—it seems that we have to be either legally registered as such OR meet all the basic criteria, like being of age, financially responsible for each other, in a mutual caring relationship, residing in the same household, etc. And as long as the actual dental insurance company has the same eligibility requirements, we should be okay.

I called my HR company to validate this research, and they confirmed that I should be able to add my partner with no repercussions. I just have to send them a Section 152 Tax Dependent Certification so that his plan is pre-taxed. But that’s where I’m confused. This form is saying that in order for me to pay premiums for a domestic partner on a pre-tax basis, he “must qualify as a tax dependent under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code.”

So does that mean I HAVE to claim him as a dependent, and if so, how will that affect our tax returns compared to if we were both filing as single?

I did chemical engineering for 1 year before I decided I hated it even more than pre-med (we're at 4.5 years of schooling now). I then stayed at the same school but switched my major to computer science. It took 2.5 years to get my computer science bachelor's degree. I had a total of 210 credits and 7 years of schooling and went straight through the summer 4 of the 6 summers.

Here is where it gets interesting. When I turned 20 years old, I started a social media marketing business hoping to ""pay for my meals"" with this side biz while I worked for $9 an hour as a pharmacy technician. This business took off so quickly that by the age of 21 it was grossing $150,000 per year. It continued to scale astronomically until the age of 23 it was grossing $400,000 per year. I was re-investing about 70% of all income because I was getting return on my investment in less than 2 months for every dollar put in. At the same time, I was not on the track to FI/RE. I spent LAVISHLY. I went on 1-3 vacations per month (I had most of my business automated and the rest could be done remotely). I wore gucci clothing and worse gold chains, this is not a joke and I am ashamed of it now. This was all during college and I did not take college seriously, did just enough to skate by. This was all fine and dandy until my social media business was shut down OVERNIGHT via a new TOS on the social media platform I was using. My accounts were scooped up by a ban algorithm. I watched $400,000 worth of assets vanish in a 20 minute period. At this time, I had $130,000 saved in the bank and my entire business was gone along with all my assets, and all of its income.

I then started to take college very seriously and knew I needed a good degree. This is the time I swapped to computer science for my final 2 years. I was in a shocked and depressive state for those 2 years and did not work a job. When I graduated with my bachelor's I had spent $70,000 of the $130,000 I had saved up. I had $60,000 in the bank and $28,000 in student loans.

Once I graduated, I got a salaried software developer position at a contracting company for $67,000 per year. In the first 6 months of my job, I completely paid off my student loan debt from my savings. Day 1 of my job I happened to get into the FI/RE movement and started maxing my roth 401k, roth IRA, HSA, and any extra money per month after bills were paid I put into brokerage.

9 months into this position I luckily got placed on a high profile project at a fortune 20 company. I worked my ass off for 3 months on this project and the company ended up being so happy with my work that they made me a job offer for $100,000 per year.

I am a few months into this position now, and have continued and will always continue maxing roth 401k, roth IRA, HSA, and the rest into brokerage.

I also am a big fan of ""automating"" income by writing programs to make me money in these niche areas. It's basically all I work on while I am not at work. These side incomes added up to $25,000 in 2019 and are on track to maybe be about $10,000-15,000 in 2020.

I have $20,000 in a HYSA for an emergency fund, I have another $25,000 in the same HYSA for a house down payment that I'm hoping to purchase next year (rlly hoping housing prices go down). I keep another \~$10,000 liquid in a checking account that I pay bills out of, I know this is steep and pretty inefficient.

Between my roth 401k, roth IRA, HSA, and brokerage: The balance of these combined just hit $45,000 today. If you're keeping up with the math, today my net worth just hit $100,000 at 26 years old!! I've only been working for 13 months since I graduated college. It's been a long road, and I was worth $130,000 at 23 (all held in a savings account), but here I am, 26 and worth $100,000.

I will answer any questions anybody has about my path or yours.","A long and winding road. Review of my finances, crazy backstory, tragic downfall, and where I am now at 26 years old."
personalfinance,"So, we are finally making the plunge and will be jumping back into the home buying market.  We are both very frugal people who live below our means and make good salaries, so it’s time to upgrade the home front and get a house that will accommodate the kids move into adolescence with enough space for everyone.  COVID is somewhat responsible for this as homes are beginning to move a bit in value here, not much, and we are not in any huge rush, but would like to do this before next year (hoping for an at least balanced market, if not a full buyers).

The big debate is, do we sell our current house or rent it out?  The city we live in has a near 100% occupancy rate on rentals, and we have fixed most major issues that could come up.  It’s also common for upkeep to be handled by tenant (snow removal, lawn mowing).  

We have adequate nest egg for a down payment on the next home to get to the 20% down, however this will leave us thin ($15k or so), but can replenish rather quickly if we just scale back on some investments...stable incomes and all that.

We bought our current home at the bottom of the 2009 market and should be able to bank $1,000+ a month excess of mortgage/tax/insurance, and have about 5 years left on the mortgage.  So after that ~$2,200 a month of income, and/or a pot of equity to dip into for other real estate purchases.  This leaves us more exposed, however could be a long term boon to aid in early retirement/de-stress career change and cash flow for opportunistic investments.

Selling would mean that we should be able to pay the next home off, without dipping into the nest egg prior to kids college.  This is also an attractive option, safer, but upside is lacking, basically removes the opportunity for moving to a low stress job before 60 without another investment outperforming expectations.

Both of us enjoy our jobs, however both are long hour high stress, and we already at late 30’s/early 40’s see the signs of burn out.  We work as hard, but honestly don’t love it as much as some of our coworkers who are addicted to the chase.  So getting into a job such as mowing lawns for a golf course, or moving to retail (something both of us did and loved in college) is ideal.  The consulting route is possible, but will take an opening to do and is only an option for me (but could be a lucrative one).

So, I’m leaning renting, my wife selling, but trusts my judgement as I’ve more been the financially involved partner.  The question, are there financial pitfalls other than a bad tenant I’m missing with rental.  We have already priced out the mortgage and tax differential.  Reviewed increased prop rates for rentals and have a solid view of costs of finding a tenant and reasonable mortgage.  

Anything else to know?  

Am I overestimating the power of passive income and equity?

The house we’re putting an offer on is $775K. The mortgage at 5% is about $4,550 and the mortgage at 20% is $3,350 (saving $550 by PMI alone). By closing time, we’ll have roughly $150K in cash and $30K in retirement accounts. 

If we do 5%, we’ll have plenty of cash to make updates (planning at least $10-15K), save for emergency fund (~$40K), pay off a car ($25K, $585 payment), and still have plenty left over. 

At 20%, we’ll have to dip into retirement to come up with the $155K. Then, we’ll have maybe $25K to make updates and some for a safety net. Thankfully, we can replenish the retirement accounts later and pay no penalties due to COVID. We can then use the extra $1,200 a month to replenish savings, pay down debts, etc. Also, when we decide to move we can likely rent the house out for $4,500-$5,000.

personalfinance,"Yesterday I applied for the Chase Sapphire card and was quite confused when it denied. I’ve been a Chase customer for 11 years with exceptional payment history, consistent usage, and no issues at all (carrying the Chase Ritz Carlton Rewards the last 5) After getting through to a lending officer they informed me I was denied because I have no credit activity and zero credit usage since 2017. 

Upon checking the big 3, they all show that account was closed in 2017. My FICO score is still 778, but with no credit activity I have no idea what my options are to obtain alternative credit.

personalfinance,"Hello. I am a 35 year old making about 55k a year and have no retirement savings. My current employer doesn’t have a 401k, much less a matching option. I want to save for retirement, but am unsure of some of the options.

I also have a 17 year old, who is about to graduate and hopefully attend college in a year. 

I’ve seen the traditional 401k &amp; ROTH IRA. From what I understand, the main difference is annual contribution caps, and taxes before contributing. 

Recently, a family friend at NYL suggested we contribute to a whole life insurance plan that offers dividends, instead since contributions are taxed before, and we won’t pay taxes on the withdraw (when tax rates are expected to be higher). This policy rate was based on how much money I wanted per month at retirement.

I’ve read a lot about whole life policies and staying away from them, but I haven’t seen anything specifically discussed about this dividend policy. 

My fear is the ROTH not accruing as much as they say this NYL policy will. 

Another selling point was that I had access to the money at any time, no penalty for “borrowing” from myself and I didn’t have to pay it back. 

My partner and I have about 20k in cash, and have already budgeted a savings amount for our house purchase. 

Can anyone help shed some light on what we should do?",Retirement options / Whole Life Divedends help

Here is some background: I'm a 23 year old female that just graduated college. I used to have a full time job but due to COVID my hours have been cut in half. I'm still working but I qualified for partial unemployment. 

Two weeks ago I got my first payment of approximately 610 dollars. I put most of it in savings and the rest on bills. Still reported correctly of my wages, hours, and earnings. Wednesday, I filed for my second payment and got an email yesterday that I'll be receiving payment soon.

I checked my bank account today since my boyfriend and I were getting takeout and I wanted to see if I had enough money. I got over $1,800 from unemployment. 

I am 99% sure this is incorrect. My hours have been consistent as well as my pay. There has been nothing that has changed. I made sure I correctly put in the information. 

I checked TWC website to see what I can do. I have deduced that I can't do anything until tomorrow and I absolutely dread calling them because I'm afraid they will not answer. I cannot email them unless I got a notice from them that they overpaid, if I'm understanding correctly.

personalfinance,"I'm buying a new car this weekend and not really sure I understand the financing options that are available to me.  Hoping someone with more fluency around this stuff can check my math and logic and let me know if my thinking &amp; numbers make sense.

TL;DR: I'm trying to understand how loans work over the long term &amp; find the optimal balance between cash payments vs. loan amounts.

\---

Let's say the cost of the car is $24,000.

My two options are:

1.  Getting a $1,500 manufacturer incentive for the cost of the car (bringing the price down to $22,500) and borrowing through them: $22,500 at 2.99% apr for 66 months.

or

2.  Instead taking the other incentive, which is the full cost of the car (24,000) at 0% apr for 66 months.

&amp;#x200B;

With Option 1, I think the breakdown is this:

Amount of loan needed: $24,000

Amount of loan needed after $1,500 dealer incentive: $22,500

Total Interest paid at 2.99% apr for 66 months on a $22,500 loan: $1,928.70

Total paid: $24,428.70

&amp;#x200B;

With Option 2, the cost is $24,000, and 0% apr for 66 months is ... $24,000.

So all other things being equal, I'm paying $428.70 more with Option 1.  Is that right?

&amp;#x200B;

Now...does that logic break down if the cost of the car drops?

Changing assumptions, let's say I intend to put $15,000 cash towards the purchase price of $24,000, making the potential loan amount be $9,000.

&amp;#x200B;

With Option 1:

Amount of loan needed: $9,000

Amount of loan after $1,500 dealer incentive: $7,500

Total Interest paid at 2.99% apr for 66 months on a $9,000 loan: $642.90

Total paid: $8142.90

&amp;#x200B;

With Option 2:

the cost is $9,000, and 0% apr for 66 months is ... $9,000.

In this scenario, if I take advantage of Option 1, I'm coming out ahead $875.10.  Is that right?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, is my best move here to balance my cash down to amount borrowed such that I wind up paying an amount in interest equal to the $1,500 dealer cashback incentive?  So:

Cost of car: $24,000

Cost of car after $1,500 dealer incentive: $22,500

Upfront cash payment of $5,000 of the available $15,000 = $17,500 to borrow

Total Interest paid at 2.99% apr for 66 months on a $17,500 loan: $1,500.10

Total paid: $22,500

Then use the remaining $10,000 in cash I have to cover \~35 monthly payments of $288.

&amp;#x200B;

If you take the time to think through this and give me advice, you're a saint!

Being that I am at an entry level salary and just started this week, I am legitimately worried about being approved for a lease.  I have a lot saved up and plan to strictly budget myself to make the payments, but I do not have anybody who can, or wants to, co-sign.  I’ve literally asked everybody I know, and none of them are able to do it.  

Out of the tours I have been on, I found two apartments that I really liked.  I liked one of those two more than the other, but I’d still live in the second one in a heartbeat.  Therefore, as unethical as it probably is, I filled out an application for both.  There was no “good faith” deposit for either, but the first one charged $20 for a credit check and the second charged $50.  I have very good credit (729) but I can understand how my income could be concerning to landlords, so I thought I would increase my options by doing this.  I don’t plan on applying for any more than these two for now, but I still feel bad giving the listing agent and landlord of apartment I liked less false hope.

I especially feel bad because the listing agent for the second apartment asked for a move-in date if I was approved, and I gave him one.  However, there was no deposit required yet, and I know this isn’t legally binding, but I still feel bad.  If I get approved for both and take the place I like better, it’s very likely that the listing agent for my second choice would never want to work with me again (which I can’t blame him for).  I haven’t told either place about the other one because I don’t want to hurt my chances.  Anyway, do you guys think I’m being an unethical jerk by doing this, or is it more common than I think?  I don’t mind hearing the truth.  If I made an excellent income and knew for sure I’d get approved, I would never do this.

personalfinance,"Hello everyone,

**1. Realtor first or lender first?**

I've been interested in buying a house for some time and have worked for about 3 years now. When I do research, it seems like websites from lenders suggest reaching out to lenders first, and websites from real estate agents suggest reaching out to real estate agents first, so I am wondering what my first step should be.

My initial thoughts are to:

1. Use online mortgage calculators to get a rough ballpark
2. Get a prequalification from any random bank/lender (not preapproval), to get a stronger idea of how much I can afford
3. Talk to a real estate agent with the prequalification, and see if they can suggest a lender with good rates for the actual preapproval
4. Get a preapproval
5. Get house

Does this sound reasonable? I'm not sure if this is standard, or if I should just talk to a real estate agent first so that they can help me through all the steps. I'm also not sure where to look for real estate agents other than Yelp, which may have biased reviews. Does anyone have any advice?

**2. Sanity checking prequalification math**

For the online prequalification step, I tried to use online calculators to estimate how much home I can afford (I'm just trying to get as much information as I can before I do anything). My situation is that I have a fixed salary, but ~50% of my income is in company stock (not options, they give me actual stock). I don't plan on using the stock as part of income calculations, but they do contribute to what I can provide as a down payment.

Note: I live in California, so every number below is going to be inflated.

If I just use my salary ($150,000), I see prequalification calculators say I can get qualified up to ~$600k of houses. Does this include the down payment? ~$600k won't get me anything, and the houses I'm looking at  (3-4 bedrooms to possibly rent out some, ~1500sqft) are more in the $800k-1mil range (a little further out of town).

I put all my assets into a spreadsheet. If I liquidate my short term assets, then after taxes (highest bracket) I will have $130k. If I liquidate my long term assets, then after taxes I will have $165k (so liquidating everything will yield 130+165=295). I have about $90k liquid on top of that (I got scared after US-China trade war situation, so lucked out with the virus situation) and $25k emergency savings that I will not touch. I also have $130k in 401k, but I don't plan on borrowing or withdrawing from it.

Preferably I don't liquidate everything as my investments generally make more than the loan rates I'm looking at (4%). I am looking to put probably 20-25% down.

I'm single with no debts nor children, but I am paying for a part of my sister's med school tuition (~30k/yr). Other than that, any other expenses are minimal (I basically live like a frugal college student and am comfortable with that).

I always make my payments for it. I pay about $370 a month and it's a great deal (because my stepdad cosigned).


My stepdad texted me out of the blue saying that I need to call USAA (the bank that loaned us the money) and to take him off the loan and then he won't be a cosigner.


If he were to be taken off as a cosigner, wouldn't my interest and monthly payments be higher ? Can you even take a cosigner off ?

Would I still be able to take him of the loan as a cosigner and still pay my exact car payments ? I can totally afford paying this car.

I moved back to the US 2 years ago, and discovered that in about 2016, a payment on this account went delinquent and was ultimately transferred to a collection agency. I only discovered this when I applied for a credit card when I moved back and was refused. I kind of panicked at the time, and just paid the collection agency the outstanding fee, it was only a couple of hundred dollars. I was able to track down the occupants who had been paying the bill in the intervening time, and it seems like the last missed payment was a genuine error, so when the collection agency asked if I wanted to flag it as fraud, I declined.

personalfinance,"So my boyfriend recently bought a used car from some used dealership in Maryland. He filled out an application, showed his bank statements and that was about it, because he is self employed, he didn't really have much else to show.  The dealership approved him with a high interest rate, collected a $9,000 down-payment and we drove home to Virginia. Several weeks later (I guess just over a month maybe?), the dealership never forwarded any information about how to pay the monthly payments. Then, they called him and said he needs to show further proof of income or he basically has to bring the car back.  He definitely doesn't have further proof of income, we just make money doing real estate stuff and don't have normal jobs right now.  What can he do now?  The dealership manager and my boyfriend disputed about it on the phone and the manager basically threatened him and said if he wasn't more respectful that he'd call the cops and report the car as stolen (because my boyfriend had insinuated that the manager was a liar). He said that my boyfriend can return the car but that he wouldn't get back his full down-payment because there would be depreciation from the mileage.  The manager promised to try and call ""the bank"" (wouldn't tell him what bank) and try to straighten it out.  But we don't think it will be straightened out.

• CD- I shopped around for recent CDs and APYs seem to have dropped tremendously as we are heading towards a recession so the returns aren't very high (is this interpretation correct?)

The idea is we'll save up another few thousand, then go travel for a bit in Southeast Asia, and if we can get a few hundred in passive income monthly, ideally $500, and then do some remote freelancing/online english teaching to hit 1k-$1500/mo between the two of us, on top of our savings, we can sustain ourselves for a while.

The first idea is to use it as a down payment on a rental property, although we're in southern California, and we're still learning about all this, I'm not sure if we can find a decent investment for $20k down that will produce cashflow, let alone $500. The more I learn, the less I feel that this is the type of thing where she'll be able to buy a property, get a property manager, and peace out and expect this to bring in hands off passive income.

Next on the list seems to be dividend investments. It seems like the highest of these return about 4-5%, so at best she'd get about $1,000 a year, or $83 a mo, which... is not much.

Hope everyone is staying safe in these crazy times. I've recently decided to take control over my investments as I've been paying Merrill Edge to handle them the last 10 years (I know, young and dumb). While it's done well, I'm tired of paying for something I can do on my own. After a ton of reading the last couple of days, I feel like I have a pretty solid plan. 

Starting next week, I'm dumping all my ROTH into Vanguard's 2055 TD Fund through Merrill. I also have a CMA taxable account that's a mess due to the advisor.

For the CMA, I want to switch it to a mix of VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX; likely a 90% stock / 10% bond ratio. 

My question is since I'm funding my ROTH with the CMA, I still have money from my paycheck I can contribute. This is after 10% into my company's 401k starting in July.

I am 28yrs old and I have a 2017 Honda Civic on lease. Initially, I didn't plan on taking a lease (originally wanted to buy out a cheaper used) but my circumstances at the time led me to go this route. Well now my lease will end in 2 months, and I just recently lost my job partly due to the pandemic lock down but also because the business owner suddenly passed away a month ago. Fortunately, I have scrimped and saved every penny that I could while working minimum wage jobs these past 4 years. Never went out to eat, ate cheap at home, and mainly just paid for necessities. Now I have enough to pay off the buyout price for my lease with a little bit of emergency money to cover my living expenses for the next 4-5 months. Originally I planned to use the money I saved to go back to school this year, but things happen and in life you must adapt accordingly. My question is should I just go ahead and buy out the car at the end of the lease since I don't know if I would be able to get a decent car loan or any car deal without current proof of a decent income.  I am also hesitant to get an older, cheaper used vehicle because I had one (with low mileage) before the Civic and while I'm thankful for all the car repair/maintenance lessons it has taught me as a new car owner, it was also very, very scary and stressful at times. And I just don't want to take another gamble with another used car/car history. My old car sometimes broke down/overheated (even after I would replace a couple of engine/cooling parts) and one time the power steering wheel turned off while I was turning at a light. I also never want to be in the situation again where I have to walk out in the summer months (especially in AZ) just to get the little groceries I could carry in my backpack cause my car was crap.   
Any input is appreciated. 

 \- I plan to work my butt off these next few weeks to find a job ASAP, but I just want to plan ahead and try to get advice or opinions now.   


Some other financial info/factors (don't know if this matters, probably could skip this):

\- I also plan to go back to school this year, even if I have to take out a loan. It will be in a healthcare related field so I plan to take out a subsidized loan and either work hard to pay it off later or try to aim for one of those Non-profit student forgiveness loan programs.   
\- Having a cosigner is not really feasible because most of my family members either will not or cannot help me right now. Plus, I really don't want to go through this route cause I am working on cutting ties with my family at the moment and any help I receive from them usually comes with strings attached.

personalfinance,"Hi I’m [28M] newly engaged to my [25F] SO. She has $65K saved up and we’re trying to decide what we should do with it. I’ve just graduated med school and we’ve just moved to a new HCOL city for my residency training. She is a therapist making 80k/year and my salary is ~55k for 5 years of residency. We’re currently renting and pay $1500/mo and are very happy and thinking we’d probably like to rent for five years as opposed to buying a home.

The only debt we have is $165k that I have in student loans. However we don’t want to put the money towards that just because we don’t feel that it would be fair to use her money for my loans this “early” on in our relationship.

We both fully fund our Roth’s for a few years now and each have roughly $20k in there. We also have a combined emergency fund (~ 10k). 

My question is since we don’t need this money for the foreseeable future (5+ years), should we DCA into VOO or some other index fund? She’s new to investing and if left to her she would watch it pile up in a savings account. Any thoughts would be appreciated.",Where to invest extra 65K??

personalfinance,"I'm new-ish to investing, 23 years old with a custodial account rolled over to me when I turned 21, opened up a Roth IRA and I've been responsible for my own investing ever since. Have some individual stocks, some mutual funds, a pretty good balance.

One thing I noticed after I did the numbers is that when I'm reinvesting the dividends on my individual stocks (not the mutual funds, I always reinvest those) most of the time I'm only getting fractions of a share (when my dad was doing this when I was young he'd buy like 10-15 shares). So I'd get a share every 2-3 years. Woohoo...

I recently bought about 80 shares of something that's going to make me about 4 shares a year (at that price). So those dividends I will reinvest. My conclusion is that it really depends on the price of the stock, what the dividend is, and how much of it you have. But does that sound reasonable? Because with all the dividends of the 10-15 share stocks I have combined I came up with about $250 a year I could put into a mutual fund or something. So at what point is it worth just taking what would have been reinvested and buying something else?",At what point does it become pointless to reinvest dividends in an individual stock?

I just refinanced the house and won't have a payment next month and I'll get escrow returned, as well as receiving thousands in stimulus money.  I have two loans, a car loan $4700, $300/mo with 2.79% interest and a student loan $5200, $206/mo @ 6.5% but currently no payment/interest due. I can pay off either of these right now, and I want to get rid of one just to be able to relax a bit and have less monthly payments to worry about.  Of course I can apply the payment amount of the paid off loan to the remaining loan to help eliminate it faster.

Reasoning to eliminate car loan:  I can pay it off now and own the car, apply $300/mo to student loan when that starts up again.  Also, I don't know what the federal government will do with student loans due to covid, I'd be pissed if I paid it off and suddenly they forgave part of the debt, I doubt that would happen but you never know.

Reasoning to eliminate student loan: Higher interest and its just annoying to have a student loan.

I updated the address under the contact preferences of my account profile with the bank after moving. I assumed it was simply for documents the bank might need to mail. There was no disclaimer/pop-up/fine print which would have led me to believe there was the slightest chance it could result in a material negative change to my account; After all, I was still using my US card, issued by a US bank, and making payments on it from my US checking account. 

called the bank and the lending officer told me their decision was due to having “zero credit utilization and no credit activity for multiple years” I asked if they could pull up my current account with the them that would show I do have the required activity - didn’t matter.  

Experian/Transunion/Equifax all show the account was closed in 2017. Would they have each determined this independently, or is it more likely my bank reported the account as closed?

By the nature of my job I'm gone a lot which means she needs to be a stay at home mom. She's currently on docs orders to not go back to work before birth and her work is telling her she MUST fill out unpaid fmla papers asap which seems really odd. In short, between fmla and short term leave were trying to protect her position until I likely get furloughed in Oct and we'll then reverse our roles, she'll go back to work and I'll be a stay at home dad while on unemployment until my job opens back up in 6-12 months (expect the worst, hope for the best, but I'm a lower seniority airline pilot so who knows)

So the questions now are.. should we file fmla now? It's unpaid and from what i can tell exempts her from getting and SSDI benefits while she's out with the pregnancy. Is this correct? If she doesn't use or is denied fmla, could she then use disability while pregnant/birthing/newborn care?

I recently came into some unexpected money due to an estranged grandparents life insurance policy because my dad is dead and I took his place as the beneficiary. 

I received about 120k and found out that in 4 years I will receive about 600k more. I’ve read a bunch of the wikis here and due to having no debt, the next suggestion was to save for a down payment for a home so I thought this would be a good idea. However, I live in San Diego which is pretty expensive. 

With that down payment and my current salary I would be able to afford a 1 bedroom home here which is great for now but I eventually want to be a foster parent and will need a 2 bedroom to do so, so this wouldn’t be a forever home. Is buying a home now to have a lower monthly payment a good idea or should I continue renting and work on investing some of that money and wait until I receive that second payment to buy a home I would stay in forever?

I am not very experienced with this stuff so bear with me as I try to explain some bullet points. 

We have a main LLC of which the 5 band members are equal 20% members. Then we each have our own LLC’s that receive distributions at varying times of the year (Usually after a big tour when we have grossed several hundreds of thousands of dollars). 

In 2017 I noticed that my individual LLC quarterly estimate payments to the IRS were pretty high. My return of 10k was then sent to cover estimates for the next year, however it was “misapplied by the IRS.”

In 2018, due to negligence on my part, I didn’t realize that our biz managers were just straight up not paying estimates, and at the end of 2018 I owed a LOT. Like 40k or so. 

Anyways, I understand I wasn’t on my game when I should have been, but my question is how I should move forward. I have been assured that my owed taxes have been paid now, yet the IRS website still shows that I owe 28k for 2018, and that 2017 has yet to be filed.

personalfinance,"Hi all- thanks for everyone who contributed to the wiki page for the death of a loved one. Huge help in wading through the unexpected loss of my father. 

My dad managed all of the finances for himself, my mother as well as my aunt and uncle. I’ve been spending the last week picking apart his accounts to find out what money is going from where to who to what. I have a clear picture now. It’s all intertwined. 

My question- I need to set my mother and my aunt and uncle up with new credit card accounts, to begin transferring bills and bill payments into their names. 

My mother has excellent credit. 

My aunt and uncle do not. 

I’m on nerd wallet doing my research- is there any major DOS or DON’TS as we set this up? 

Before my father passed, he worked to wipe out ALL of my aunt and uncles debt. They have no credit card debt that I am aware of. 

My mother doesn’t have any credit cards solely in her name currently. She is an authorized user on my dads AMEX account. She has no CC debt. 

There is an Amex card in my dads name for about $11k- that account was being used by my father, mother, aunt and uncle. They were all authorized users on the account. Estate Lawyer told us we didn’t need to do anything with this card just yet, but if we called to report the death it wouldn’t matter, it was up to us. I’m trying to move any auto payments from this card to the new accounts before it gets shut down.  Only issue is none of the surviving family members have another credit card to use right now so I’m trying to get everyone with new credit cards set up before this AMEX account disappears. 

The big issue here- all of these family members are financially illiterate. It took us days just to figure out my parent’s joint checking account. My mom has not ever had to manage finances. My aunt and uncle don’t even use debit cards. These are people in their early 60s. No one is collecting social security yet. 

My aunt and uncle dug themselves into a deep hole of debt that my dad helped them out of since 2017. My dad bought their house in 2019 because it was underwater, and had been managing their day to day finances the last four years. My uncle pays my dad weekly to manage the finances. My dad has been going $1k into his own pocket each month to cover their overall expenses. 

We are trying to unravel all of this- getting there bit by bit. 

I guess I’m just looking to vent/some advice here as we unwind. I’m literally at the point where I figured out the bills and where the money is coming from and going to. Now I need to reroute everything and set everyone loose. 

It’s overwhelming. I’m overwhelmed. My dad has spreadsheets detailing everything which has been helpful. However he was crafty leveraging lines of credit, debt and cash flow to cover all of the expenses. Without him, his expertise and his income, we have to make changes. My mom can’t afford to support my aunt and uncle. No one can afford to be on their homes now without him. We have to unload the homes. It’s a whole fucking thing.

Through the process described in the following links at bottom, it is now ""UberCash"" usable only on Uber, Uber Eats, and UberJump (scooters). Money just got downgraded to a gift card, more or less. I totally get I screwed up and could've been more attentive and applied this to my credit card bill before the policy change. 

But here I am, so what can I do now?

1. Is there any way to dispute this conversion and get the money applied to my credit card balance nonetheless? I called regular customer support, had a manager call me back the next day, told them I will close the card if they cannot compromise for at least some of the balance. They did not budge at all.
2. Resigning myself to the most likely outcome, any advice for how to smartly use so much Uber/Uber Eats money? In normal times I actually could work through this rides in a reasonable timespan, esp. considering rides to airports. But that's not happening any time soon. Besides using Uber Eats instead of other delivery services, any non-obvious ideas I haven't thought of?
3. Is there a class action or anything about this? It's obviously really sleazy but I don't know how legally solid the move is.

personalfinance,"Hello everyone.  I posted a condensed version of this question in the daily thread, but I think it got buried.  I'll start with my situation.

I am 27, married, U.S.A - Idaho.  My wife and I made around $40k last year.  Our debt is finally under control, and by that I mean we are following the ""pay the highest interest rate first"" method while we pay minimums.  Nothing insane in terms of debt, around $3000 that we plan to have paid off by fall.

My situation is concerning my credit score, however.  I have about $5000 in collections, most from anywhere from 4-5 years ago, a couple more recent.  I read the wiki on collections and I don't think I am understanding a couple of things.

First, I don't understand why I need to send a debt validation letter after asking for a validation notice.  Wouldn't the validation notice fulfill whatever I'd be requesting by sending them a debt validation letter?  I guess what I'm asking is for someone to break this down to me even further, because it's confusing me.

Second, I know that the best course of action with collections accounts is to let them die, but my issue is that the debt keeps being sold and it pops up on my credit report as a month or two old when it's from 2015.  I want to let many of them fall off naturally, but won't the repurchasing of this debt prevent this from happening?

Third, is there a reason a phone call is the preferred method of initial communication rather than sending a letter via certified mail?

I'm currently domestic, but will be going into training and then overseas (AKA rent-free status) next March. I've been thinking about house-buying strategies and it seems like there's 3 schools of thought:

1. Buy something as soon as possible and get tenants paying your mortgage for you. Property Manager will do all the work, you're good to go except for big maintenance expenses.
2. Build up a big down payment and when you come back domestic in 5-7 years you can buy in the DC area. Live there for a few years then rent it out/pay it down when you go back overseas.
3. (The Full-Ramsey) Debt is dumb, mortgages are dumb, you're retirement is secure with your pension and TSP, so just save up cash and ditch the interest that comes with a mortgage.

1 seems too hasty.

2 seems pretty sensible, but I've heard lots of horror stories about tenants and how much of a headache it is.

personalfinance,"Ok so a bit of a story. When I was 18, I completely screwed my credit. I got a car from one of those places that make you pay every 2 weeks, and have the ability to make your car not start if you miss a payment. I was about 2 months ahead on payments (all done within 1 month). Well before I could even get the car licensed, it ended up needing repairs that I couldn't afford (after paying a shop to replace the alternator) so I told them to just take the car back. I didn't know what that meant and it stayed on my credit report (along with other stuff like maxed out and unpaid credit cards, payday loans, school loans, and a phone bill that went to collections) until about a year and a half ago. 

So since then I've been trying to rebuild my credit with secured loans and a secured credit card. My score has improved DRAMATICALLY. The whole reason I started even trying to improve my credit, was to become a home owner.

 I'm renting an apartment now while my score keeps improving (they're ranging from 600 even to 625 right now) and I'm just not quite sure where to go from here. 

While I do want to be a home owner, I don't have a vehicle right now and I'm wondering if I should stay in my apartment and get a car with a loan, or go for the home first. I live in a bigger city so transportation isn't impossible but it would be amazing to leave for work 10 minutes before I have to be there instead of an hour before.

I am an unmarried 24 years old woman with no kids. I live in a state with no income tax. I've worked in the tech industry for 1 year and make $112k gross income. I have 0 debt. I pay $1200 per month on rent and $600 on food. I barely spend money on anything besides rent and food since I don't have a car or expensive hobbies.

$12k - Traditional 401k

$400 - Roth 401k

personalfinance,"(Ontario, Canada) 

So, I graduated last year (April 2019) with almost 30k in student loan debt (all government). I am a registered nurse, and have recently started a permanent full-time position. I started at my job last July, and have been working almost full time hours anyways since then. Since I took a permanent full time, I no longer get in-leau of benefits/vacation time on my paychecks, which translates to losing a few hundred dollars every pay period, but I have secure hours now!

Right now there’s is a hold on my student loan payments/interest due to covid, and these will restart in October. 

My debt currently looks like this: 

29k in student loans ($350 a month in payments starting again in October)

5.3k on line of credit (used it to purchase my vehicle, interest rate is 4.6% until Dec.2020 then increases to 7.5% I believe, monthly payments are $90)


I currently live rent free with my boyfriend (goal is to pay off my debt and then start contributing more, bless him), but I pay for half of utilities (approx $200-$300 a month). I also split groceries, as well as any household purchases etc.

So, realistically my monthly expenses all add up to about $815 ($1165 when student loan payments commence) plus depending on what we spend on groceries and household buys (still furnishing a house) maybe another $300-$500 a month. I make just over $33 dollars an hour. 


My bank account currently has just under 13k, and I am receiving a tax refund of almost 6k in the next few weeks. What would be the smartest thing to do with this money? 

My original goal was to throw down at least 15k on my student debt come October (before payments restart), but my boyfriend thinks I should just pay off the line of credit in full now. I might be able to swing both. I want to keep at least 5k in my account at all times for emergencies (especially if my parents need emergency support during covid).","Student loan, car debt, or save?"

personalfinance,"Weird question, not sure if I'm missing something. I got a job and moved back home with my parents to save money, and then the pandemic hit. I'm guessing I'm not switching jobs or moving out anytime soon (I wasn't making enough money to afford it anyway).

Current wealth breakdown (I have a little over $40k total)

* About $11k in my emergency fund
* another $8k in a savings account (I'm planning to invest some of this in stocks at some point I just haven't gotten around to it)
* About $21k in the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (planning on diversifying this at some point as well, I'm still reorganizing my finances)
* I'm debt free

The following scenario is short term. Because of the pandemic and living at home my cost of living is around $500 a month, maybe less. **I make $1750 every two weeks, $1,380 after taxes are taken out**. That works out to **$2,760 per month**.

\--------------------

Subtract $500 for my monthly 'expenses', that leaves me with $2,275 per month. Even though I have a ton of savings right now I still think it's worth saving a little in cash so subtract another $350 towards savings, which leaves me with **$1,825 in surplus income per month**.

I want to put around $836 into my Roth 401k each month (about 24% of my gross salary) and invest another $988 per month into index funds (like the Fidelity 500 index fund) (\~28% of my gross salary). I know that's a huge chunk of my salary but:

* I am living at home with very low expenses and no urgent bills (no rent)
* I'm not eating out, shopping, buying gas, etc. because of the pandemic so I'm saving even more money
* My job seems relatively secure for the moment (and I'm making so little anyway that even if I lost my job, my total income wouldn't be reduced significantly while PUA is in effect)
* I have a decent amount in my emergency fund. This is the only point that I'm stuck on. I wouldn't have plans to move out of my parents' house at the moment unless I found a new higher-paying job even without the pandemic, so I'm not sure if my emergency fund should factor in rent. It seems silly to leave all that money in a savings account right now when I can't imagine a scenario where I would not be able to live at home. On the other hand, I guess that's what emergency funds are for, right?
* The stock market is down about 12% - 15% of its value since February. This is the lowest priority excuse because I'm not big on timing the stock market but it's an extra incentive to put that surplus $1.8k into index funds rather than letting it build up in a savings account

\--------------------

I want to add that once life returns to normal and my expenses go up again I would not plan to continue this. I feel like this is a unique opportunity to invest a lot of money and if I weren't doing it paycheck by paycheck that money would just be building up in a savings account over the next several months and I'd probably be lump sum investing it anyway.

\--------------------

Are there any glaring flaws to this plan that I'm missing? The emergency fund is the part I'm mostly stuck on. Right now I have $11k in the fund; if I somehow lost my job *and* got kicked out of my house, I think I would need around $15-$20k to survive for 6 months. The thing is that I can't forsee a situation in the next few months or years where I would not be able to live at home. My parents have a stable job and if I wasn't able to live at home it would mean that my whole family (parents + me + siblings) would be out on the street and I'd have bigger problems to worry about. The $11k is more than enough to cover any surprise emergencies (i.e. car problems, etc.) in the near future. Even without the pandemic it just feels silly to keep $20k in a savings account while I'm living at home and not in danger of failing to pay rent. I do plan to beef the fund up once I move out of the house but at the moment it feels like overkill. But I'm definitely willing to do it if that's the smart thing to do.

personalfinance,"Looking for a little advice here. My wife and I have a lot of options, but we're not quite sure whats the best approach to our scenario.

My wife (27) and I (24) have one child (7.5 mo), and we are expecting twins this November. Currently for cars we have a 2013 Hyundai Elantra (Paid off) and a 2015 Ford Escape (8.1k remaining at 4.94%) both running just fine with no issues and get regular maintenance. Our plan was to pay off the Escape early this summer to get it over and done with, but with the news that we are expecting Twins now so close after our first child, that threw a lot of financial plans for a loop. We live in a Medium/Low COL city in the Midwest. We are both solid in our jobs with no chance of being laid off. She is a Teacher and just got out for the summer, I am a Software Developer and my company has hardly been touched by Covid other than everyone works from home now.

Currently we have \~30k saved up in a HYSA, which includes our 6 month+ emergency fund, savings for house improvements like the carpet that we are planning to put in our basement this summer, and enough to cover our medical insurance deductible and OOP Maximum (8k for a HDHP).

We are in need of a bigger car with 2 more kids on the way, since there's no way we can fit 3 car seats in the back of the Elantra or the Escape. Both of our families live 4-5 hours away in opposite directions, so we travel quite a bit (as do they) to see them. My wife wants a minivan since we are planning more kids after these 3 (and we have a Border Collie).

Our current plan is to swap the Elantra to a used minivan this summer (something 2012-2018 with lower mileage is between 10-15k here) and keep the Escape. Credit Scores are Me (750+), Her (790+)

Where we need input is this:

1. We've been holding off on paying the Escape off and just doing normal monthly payments because of the twins on the way. Is it better to pay that off with what we've got in savings since the interest rate is above 4%? - Savings is essentially at 22k because we're expecting to hit our OOP Maximum of 8k.
2. We are planning to trade in the Elantra and put a decent down payment on and finance the minivan (no more than 48 months), is it better to pay cash for it instead of paying off the Escape? Maybe a combination and see what kind of rate we get on the minivan before paying it or the Escape off?
3. Would it be better to trade in the Escape in this scenario instead of the Elantra? Elantra gets 28-35 mpg consistently, Escape gets 20-25. Escape is newer and worth more as a trade in, but has the 8.1k of debt still attached. Escape has way more cargo space, though with a van we will be travelling in that as a family anyways. Insurance is slightly cheaper on the Elantra, though not by much.

pay off my two loans right away that are 5% interest which would bring my monthly total payment down to just $200 i think, which i would be more comfortable with

My wife is considering a new job.  We are currently covered for insurance by her old job (which has excellent coverage).  Her new job doesn't have great coverage, and mine is not super great either (but slightly better...both are high-deductible health plans).

Only upside of her new employer's benefits is that they said they would contribute the max to an HSA on her/our behalf EVEN IF we aren't under their insurance.

So, the plan after she takes the new job is to take insurance from MY employer, but also take the HSA contribution (we'd have to open our own HSA).

Further, I discovered my employer has an HRA and they contribute $1,800 for the year to the HRA.  However, I've discovered in my research that you can't have both an HRA an HSA (unless it it a certain type of HRA...which it's not).

So I guess my main questions are...

1) Can you ""decline"" HRA coverage?  I talked to someone in my HR department but she wasn't overly helpful.  She just kept saying ""the HRA comes automatically with the plan...I guess you could just not use the funds even though you have it.""  But that answer wasn't sufficient to me.  This is a big decision and could be a huge swing if that $7k all of a sudden goes away...so I don't want to rely on her ""shoulder shrug"" opinion.

2) What exactly are the logistics/mechanics that disqualify having both?  Like how would anyone know exactly?  I assume based on the tax return, but I with the HRA being employer-owned, I imagine it's not reported on my return?  Just trying to figure out exactly how I could ""decline.""

I'm a freshman college student on a full scholarship. I am transferring to a priv. university and according to their fin. aid dept, I don't qualify for need-based aid even if I file independently (which I had planned on trying to do). 

I have no debt, own my car, live with a non-filial family member rent-free, and invest my work savings ($20K as of now) in an Etrade account (stocks and ETFs) that is currently beating the market by 30%\*. I consider myself thrifty (use the library for entertainment, no subscriptions, cook at home/coupon, etc).

I realize there are advantages to IRAs/annuities but, I am having trouble do a cost-benefit analysis between the low-return annuities/their fees, the IRAs, and a simple low-cost index fund investing via Etrade/online broker. 

There will be penalties for moving funds, so my current plan was to pretend like these inherited funds don't exist, fire my CPA, and just concentrate on the Prime Directive w/ my earned money. 

I'm thinking of taking out low-interest loans to pay for the remaining 2.5 years of college because their interest rates &lt; rates of return from the inherited accounts, which means I could save some money on penalties when I inevitably have to withdraw from them to pay off my loans (doesn't look like I would make a significant dent in my capital either). 

I would really appreciate any guidance. Stay safe!

personalfinance,"Basic info about me:

* \~40 years old
* Live in the US
* Married, with five kids
* Have $20k in savings.
* Have $110k in a 401k (was more before the recent crash, but I'm assuming/hoping that will bounce back up eventually).
* Base salary is $105k, annual bonus is usually \~$10k
* Wife's salary is $16k (she could make more, but this is her dream job and we live comfortably)
* Current mortgage balance $110k, on a house worth around $170k (so $60k equity).
* Current mortgage balance $85k on an empty lot we've bought (explained below).
* Owe $20k on our minivan.
* No other debts (just the mortgages and the van).

We're currently living in a 1700 sq ft house. With several kids all growing up, and some hitting teen years, it's getting more cramped than we'd like. Wife and I have been looking at buying some land to build on. We found a large piece of land that we love, and purchased it, and are in conversations with a builder to build a house. The house we are considering building will cost \~$290k to build, so when combined with the cost of the land ($85k), we'll be looking at about a $375k mortgage. We plan to sell our current house as soon as we can move into the new house, and expect about a $50k profit from it, which will drop our balance down to $325k.

This has all been coming together over the last 6 months or so. I've been a bit uneasy about it, because $325k is a LOT of money to me, but always telling myself ""Eh, it's the next step in life, and we can afford the payments."" 

Whenever I google ""how much house can I afford"", I find multitudes of housing/budget calculators that all tell me I ""can afford"" $400k - $500k of house based on income and debt/income ratio. I put ""can afford"" in quotes because I've always been skeptical of online budget calculators/estimates. This is partly because my wife and I have so many kids, and it feels like many ""rules of thumb"" go out the window for us, because we're not a typical family. But I don't know what else to base my assumptions off of. Everything I read says around 25% of gross monthly income is an acceptable limit for housing. But by that logic, we could even go up to $500k on a 30 year mortgage.

However those numbers seem absolutely *insane* to me. I did not grow up wealthy, but we were comfortable, probably average middle-class. My first house with my wife was $80k, which we fixed up and sold for a small profit. Our current house is worth $170. Each time we've bought a house, I remember thinking at the time ""omg this is SO much money"" but we've never had trouble paying our bills or putting money into my 401k. But I really wonder when is it TOO much?

We're planning on this being our ""forever house"". In talking to the builder and making designs for the house, we're trying to get plenty of space for the kids to finish growing up, while not having a huge excess of space after they move out (don't want to retire in a mansion).

Bottom line: Am I crazy for considering buying a $325k house with an income of \~$130k and five kids to support? The debt calculators say it's well within their ""acceptable"" margins, but I still can't shake the feeling that that's well over a quarter-million dollars!

personalfinance,"I'm 24 years old currently making $46,350 a year. I'm trying my best to find and secure a more financially stable job. In the meantime, my expenses are:

\- $260 in student loans

\- $255 in car loans

\- Between $50-$150 on my credit card

\- SOMETIMES paying between $50 - $100 on my credit card

\- Saving anywhere from $500 - $600 in my savings account

&amp;#x200B;

Typically, my credit card utilization rate is below 5% and my goal is to keep it at 2% or lower. My credit score went from 764 to 759 recently due to some necessary expenses (car registration and helped my parents out with a new fridge) but since paid it mostly down. Right now I'm at $360 in credit card debt.

I hate(d) the thought of being stuck with student loans for the next 10 years, so I put a decent chunk of my savings (6k allocated to my 22k student loans) to make my monthly payments a bit more manageable almost two years ago . I made consistent payments (between $700 - $750) for 5 months but got lazy and paid the minimum for 7 months (which I regret SO much). I got handed some hefty medical bills that I paid off in 10 months which allowed me to allocate only $260 toward my loans at the time. I'm now allocating $450 a month for my student loans. Currently, I'm at $8,989 in student debt (around 4.15% interest, but due to the 'Rona situation I get a 6 month forbearance).

My old Honda broke down on me last March so I got a shiny, pre-owned Honda at 16k. I put down 4k from my savings and I've been making monthly payments at $255. My interest is at 2.9% thanks to my credit union. I'm on a 60-month repayment plan and have $10,447 remaining on my auto loan. I sometimes regret this purchase lol

As for my savings, I have $7,200 in a high-yield savings account and $3,500 in my regular savings account. I plan to allocate $1,200 toward my student loans in September.

Another note, for my biweekly expenses, I usually end up not using $20 - $80 and I end up just transferring that to my savings or credit card.

If I was unnecessarily detailed in this post, I'm sorry. I'm doing this partly for myself, so I can analyze what I'm doing wrong and how I can better improve my spending/saving habits. Thankfully, I don't have to pay rent since I live with my parents and I completely acknowledge that privilege. I know I won't be that lucky for long. I would like own property in the next 2-3 years and with my boyfriend and I's combined income of around 101k, it looks like it is doable. I'm trying to save up at least 15k for a mortgage down payment.

personalfinance,"Apologies for the long read.     

My girlfriend (and her dog) just started living with my son (11yr) and I in early January in a leased apartment. We have a joint credit card that we always pay down and split our expenses based on a percent of our aggregated income, both of these were my idea. I make way more than her, so the current split is me contributing 80%, while she contributes 20% to our joint expenses which include: rent, utilities, groceries, and household items. Due to me receiving a bonus in February, I paid all the bills due from February. Due to her being laid off in March, I paid all the bills due from March. If she gets this new job she's being working at as a temp, the monthly split will change to 72%/28%, so it's not a consistent split. Since I moved to Washington State I've been able to pay down outstanding debts considerably, without her help, to where now I can be able to afford a home comfortably.     

So here's the issue, Washington State has this thing called Committed Intimate Relationships (CIR). To me, this seems very similar to a common law marriage, with some caveats. What I'm worried about is assets. I'm going to be applying for a VA Loan, but I'm getting a mortgage that I can afford in it's entirety as if I didn't have the additional income of my partner. In the case where we break up, I need to be protected, especially for my son's sake as I'm not trying to throw money away on lawyers down the road. I've seen some people here suggesting having a lease agreement with their partner, but if I did that wouldn't I have to pay taxes on that money as though it were income?","I'm considering buying a home, worried about CIR, how do I protect myself?"

The vehicle is used but fairly new (2019 Chevy Cruze with under 18,000 miles). My credit union is now offering me several coverage options along with the loan, which I figure is just an attempt to sell me stuff I don't need but I wanted to see if people feel that any of these are worth it. The options are as follows:

-Debt Protection: pays entire loan if I die or pays for up to 24 months if I become disabled or 6 months if I end up unemployed. I'm 27, healthy and employed in a fairly secure job, so I feel this is pretty unecessary, though with the Corona virus issues I guess you can never be sure.

-Gap Insurance: covers amount not covered by my insuance in the event the car is totaled. My current insurance does not have exceptional coverage but I am a fairly cautious driver with 0 accidents so far so I don't know about this one. 

-Mechanical repair coverage: Covers repairs for 60 months or 75,000 miles with $100 deductible. Car is fairly new as mentioned above, so I'm not sure what value this will be.

Once I was put on a billable project i was due to be moved to an updated bonus of 20% of my salary instead of the previous plan of 5% of my salary. This change was due to happen in March of 2019. As of today the issue still has not been fixed.

Over time, I have reached out to several people within the organization and every single time we keep getting pushed to someone else who doesn’t know of it or it gets ignored or we get some bullshit response that they are trying their hardest to fix it. 

My coworker and I are in the same boat and we are thinking of threatening resignation at this point. We are both on the same project and if we both were to quit our project would take a huge hit since we have been on the project for 2 years and we have built rapport with the client and also built most of the functionality for the client. 

Would this be a bad idea? I hate to burn bridges but it’s at the point where I can’t imagine what’s causing them to be unable to fix the issue. I suspect that they are intentionally not fixing it. They have also specifically said they will not pay back bonuses that were supposed to be paid so basically I will not get back the 10-12k I was owed in bonuses since March 2019.

My nieces have lived with our parents (65 and 71) for several years so thankfully that part won’t change. However, my parents are getting older and they need help whether or not they’ll admit it. They make very little ($40k combined). I do help financially with $400/month but this whole thing has made it more obvious that they need physical help. Living in my hometown would also help to make an easier transition for the girls to our care if it became necessary.

personalfinance,"Alright all, I’m 19, from California and just finished a 12-Month Job/Training Program.

I managed to save $15k of my Stipend throughout the 12-months. My time here is nearly over. I have a few weeks to pack and figure out “what’s next.”

Back at home, I live in the third worst housing-to-income markets in California. I can not afford to go back there. My mother and I do not have a good relationship, (Narcissist) which is the main reason why I decided to go away right when I turned 18. 

My town is horrible. It’s like a wanna be college town with absolutely nothing to do and the apartment rates are sky high because of the UC. I do not feel I’ll be able to advance in my life if I go back and “rent a room” for the next I don’t know how long. I also just do not like the environment. I love where I am now but my room and board were provided. Rent here is actually higher than my home town. If I could stay though, I would. It’s more of a retirement/resort style town.

My goal in life is to be a police officer. I’d like to go to Texas, attend college, rent a cheap studio and find part time work when I arrive. I have culinary experience now so I see myself getting a restaurant job fairly easy. (I hope!)

After a few years, and hopefully a degree later I’d than go apply for the police academy or corrections if they’re not actively recruiting at that moment.

Is this Viable? Would I be able to relocate with $15k? I’d be able to pay a few months of the studio up front which would run me a little over $500/month.

I have a lot of anxiety about personal finance lately and I don't know if I'm stressing myself out too much.  I currently am in PT school and have two years left.  I have a 3 year old at home and have pretty much been working some odd-bottom of the barrel, garbage side jobs just to save up money.  I want to be able to buy a house as I've only been living in apartments that are pretty low cost and easy to afford.

Buying a house isn't something I've ever considered before having a family so I never used to worry as much, but I have about 7 grand saved up so far and project that I'll have somewhere around 20 saved up by the end of school.  Just looking into things like the amount paid in interest and what you need to save to not get screwed by lender's insurance is just absolutely daunting to me, and I feel like I stress out too much about it.  I have no loans to pay off from undergrad but some from grad school that shouldn't be too terrible to manage once I have to start paying them.

My fiancee tells me that she thinks I stress too much,  since I haven't even started a career yet really and thinks I'm doing ok.  But still, the whole thing scares me.  I pretty much went from just spending money on living and enjoying whatever disposable income I've had to saving.  And it's hard because I'm pretty poor atm (right now making 18 an hour at one job and 13 at the other).

I am speaking on behalf of my mother who does not speak english very well.  There was a miscommunication between her and her  workplace when filling out the unemployment benefits form.

She did not understand and reached out to a family friend to help her. They filled out a separate claim number saying that she is unemployed. My mom was approved and was  paid for one week although it should be two weeks worth of pay. When she  didn't get her second week pay, that was when we realized something  must be wrong and we have been trying to figure it out every since.

I've been installing cable for 2 years with a different company, we'll call it RWL, another Comcast business partner. Well this year Comcast would not renew their license, which would expire in August. With RWL it was easy making $700-$800 per week, but when the corona virus hit, Comcast changed regulations so techs wouldn't have to go inside someone's home. Instead they would install everything on the outside and then leave your equipment by the door. Well RWL drastically reduced how much each job paid out to compensate, more than 50%. I mean even if everything was correct outside, it may not be inside, and so the customer would just call back. Now, seems fair right? Less work = Less pay. After not that long, the techs were being told they needed to go inside to fix up their primary outlet. Now we're at Work &gt; Pay. The owners eventually said they were securing a loan from the bank so that they could pay everyone what the average was for their location. That sounded good. Never happened.

Okay, so after a little while this new company comes in and says ""Hey, we like your numbers so we want all of you to work for us. The payscale is a little different, but you'll get access to a 401K, benefits, and paid vacation."" With the new job classification from Comcast, this new company is paying only a measly $14 and some change per job. Some friends I had were already quitting so they could file for unemployment, that extra $600 per week sounded pretty tasty I'll admit. And I really wanted to. But I figured since I was still going to school, and at least I'd have a job, then it would be more beneficial if I stayed and worked, rather than to gamble on unemployment. And now I can't file unemployment anyway because I haven't been with the new company long enough.

I feel very exploited. Shafted. Taken advantage of. Other companies are either paying the same or more now, and even hazard pay. I'll be making around $2,400 a month less while these regulations are in place. I want to quit now and look for another job. But I feel stuck like a pawn who has no other option than to work here.

We had planned on doing the first time home owners loan but are not sure if it's our best bet. We would really like to get a burm home, we found a company that makes and will install the shells for a reasonable price and it's really what we want. Tired of renting and seeing how much money goes to the wind every year not adding anything to our personal wealth, we just want a way out.

personalfinance,"I've recently been shopping around to refinance my mortgage and I noticed on my credit report that I had two accounts with balances that I was unfamiliar with. Found out one is linked to my mother's credit card and the other to my grandmother's; both had authorized me as a user. I forgot about these accounts bc I never use their cards. Well, in a panic I had my mom remove me from her card that she had closed a long time ago (unknown # yrs) but she's still paying off the remaining balance. This card was opened 17 years ago (I was about 10 yo) and was the oldest account linked to me. My credit history with that account hasn't been erased.

So I’m really at a loss of what to do to limit my exposure if this happens again and/or to not have a bank that thinks I steal my own money (one of the terrible decisions was staying with a bank that’s notorious for defrauding its customers ITSELF, why on earth would I expect it to protect me from fraud by others).

personalfinance,"I just got a new job (promotion really) and will be making approximately 10k more per year (switching from hourly to salaried as well). I have a mortgage and a personal LOC (8% interest) with about a 7.5k balance which I used for some home repairs/improvements. No other debt - I own my car and pay off credit cards every month, and I have a 4 month emergency fund.

My current plan with my pay increase is to pay off the LOC asap. Then I want to increase my emergency fund to 6 months, then max out HSA contributions, then whatever's leftover put into my roth 457b. I work for a public school district so my retirement is a little different - I automatically contribute to an account managed by a state pension program, but my payout from that depends on my number of years in the state school system. If I leave the system, I can either leave my contributions and still receive partial pension, or roll them into a different retirement account, but there's no employer match. The 457b is an optional additional account that I've chosen to contribute to, but I'm currently well below the annual contribution limit.

I am not planning on working in the public school system for the entirety of my career - I'm only 29 and this new job actually represents a career change with a lot of potential in the private sector. So I guess my question is, is there anything else I should be doing with my money, retirement-wise or other?

personalfinance,"About 2 and a half years ago, I had no credit history and opened my first credit card. I didn't know much about my options so I went with a secured credit card at a local credit union. I rarely use the card these days as I now have 2 Amex cards that I prefer. There is $1000 in my credit union account (for the secured card) that I am unable to transfer, so I called them today and they said I cannot access this money unless I close the account so the funds can be released. Apparently the $1000 acts as a ""pledge"" to secure the card. Do secured cards typically work this way? This just seems odd, and when I had spoken to a different individual last week, they said I could go to the branch to sign a document to have funds released (although he sounded uncertain).

I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place because I would like to have the $1000 in an account that's actually growing - right now I'm being outpaced by inflation. However, if I close the account, I lose my oldest account which will affect my average age of accounts on my credit report. Without this account, my average account age is 3 months.

personalfinance," Hello all,

I’ve been working on this budget spreadsheet as a hobby for a while, and it’s finally at a place where I’d like to share it with the world. I’m quite hopeful this budget will be helpful to people who want a (relatively) simple, uncluttered, and aesthetically pleasing budget and expense tracker.

This budget spreadsheet has the following features:

**Variable Income:** People who don’t earn the same amount of money every month can use this budget. Each month, you will allocate the money that you earned the previous month.

**Expenses Tracker:** This budget requires that you individually type in all of your individual purchases and transactions. Eventually, I’d like for you to be able to easily import transactions &amp; expenses from bank accounts and credit cards into the transactions &amp; purchases sheet.

**Account Balances:** This budget will give you an up-to-date balance in each of your bank accounts and credit cards. This is to help you make sure you don’t overdraft your accounts, and it will also help ensure only authorized transactions are posting to your account.

**Rollover Budget Allowances (aka “Envelopes):** This budget allows you to “rollover” money each month so that you can build up larger funds in specific budget allowance categories. 

**Simple Budget Allowance (“Envelope”) Adjustments:** You can quickly and easily move money from one Budget Allowance Category (aka “Envelope”) to another in this budget.

**Minimalist, Uncluttered, Aesthetically pleasing:** My goal was to create a budget that is clean, minimalist, simple, and uncluttered. I hope I’ve done so!

I could say a lot more about the budget, but I guess the only thing to do now is share it!

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10WG24bCGiQBCpG7zCKByi3Lors\_CEe8LXjN90JV2kYU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10WG24bCGiQBCpG7zCKByi3Lors_CEe8LXjN90JV2kYU/edit?usp=sharing)

What do you like? What do you not like? **What are some features that you’d like in your “everyday” budget spreadsheet that I don’t have here?** What parts are confusing? I’d love feedback so that I can eventually create a budget spreadsheet that doesn’t require pages upon pages of instructions. I want people to be able to pick it up and use it without much thought or too steep of a learning curve!

Thanks friends! 

PS - The budget is already filled out with about 6 months worth of transactions. These transactions are all fake and are for illustrative purposes. You will, of course, delete all of the data in the yellow cells on the budget and replace it with your own data.","Simple, minimalist, zero-based budget &amp; expense tracker in Google Sheets."
personalfinance,"I bought a home last year and locked in a great interest rate of 3.375%.  However rates have come down even more since then so I've been shopping around. Seems like I can get a rate of 3% now for the same 30yr term. However the bank I'm working with actually advised against refinancing, saying rule of thumb is to do so only when rates drop a full percentage point from your current rate. I'm trying to figure out if that's good advice. Real estate is expensive in my area so the 0.375% difference would lower my payment by $160 a month. Total fees for refinancing would be around $3000. So my breakeven point would be 18 months and afterwards it's all savings for the next 28.5 years. I understand I'm pushing out the end date of my loan by a year, but even after factoring in this, the long term savings are pretty substantial. The only reason I can think of not to refinance is that rates could drop even more. However seems like rates are already near rock bottom historically. Am I missing something?

personalfinance,"I went to my doctor's office, and while I was at my appointment he requested I get bloodwork done. I walked to a different room in the office, and someone drew my blood.

How my insurance works is, if someone who works for the doctor drew my blood and then sent the blood to an independent lab, I don't get charged. If a doctor's office owns/controls a lab, and someone from that dependent lab draws my blood, I don't get charged. However, if someone from an independent lab draws my blood and then processes it there, I get charged.

Turns out, there is an independent laboratory that runs out of the doctor's office. If that's where I got my bloodwork done, it looks like any regular room at a doctor's office, no clear indication that it's a separate laboratory. 

I don't know if I got my blood drawn from someone who works for the doctor or the lab, because the lines between the two are so blurry. It literally just seemed like I went into another room when I went.

personalfinance,"I recently moved out of a rental and due to the pandemic there was a delay in the landlord performing out-processing. When we left, we did a walk through on video chat and showed him the entire place. The only things that were wrong were:

* The oven wasn't thoroughly cleaned. It was wiped and scrubbed but we were unable to run the clean cycle. Never had a chance because smoke that emits from the oven during the cycle and it was still too cold outside to leave the doors and windows open for several hours. The oven didn't have any major spills. It was barely used during out time there. 

Aside from that the place was spotless. We spent over 6 hours scrubbing everything twice and wiping everything down. Landlord said he was fine with the state of things when we left.

* 3 laminate slats in one of the bedrooms had quarter sized scratches in them from bed movement over the 2 years we were there. There were two completely filled unopened boxes of the exact same slats the owner had left over in the storage closet. And we reminded the landlord of their whereabouts in the event that he would want to replace them.

* Transition plate between a couple rooms had come loose. It was perfectly in tact. Upon inspection it looked like it was only glued down with a single zigzag strip of some putty or adhesive.

When we did the virtual walkthrough we clearly outlined all of these things he said everything else looked good. Come 2 months later, he deducts [around $800](https://imgur.com/a/kkdwEGf) from our security deposit listing some pretty inflated charges for everything ($50 to ""repair"" the transition strip, $425 to repair the ""holes"" in the floor, $105 to clean the oven). There even seem to be a few things added to the list that weren't even problems at the time like replacing smoke detector that was never even set off ($60) and painting baseboard trim ($200). 

When I saw the invoice, immediately contacted him stating I wanted to contest the charges as things seemed to be either inflated or added with no grounds. He told me to Email him stating my concern and what we think the charges should have been, but that ""he has receipts for everything so
that is the market rate and everything was contracted out. 

My question is do these seem like fair charges given the situation? What recourse do we have?

Sort of relevant:

This is not the first problem we had with this landlord or property the two years we were there. The laundry room completely flooded every time it rained for more than an hour. when we told him he said that it was a problem with the building (townhome complex) and that the problem was out of his hands. One of the mirrors in the room had a huge crack in it. We were told multiple times that he was sending someone to fix it, but that never happened. Blamed it on the owner. The laminate in another bedroom became warped a would no longer stick to the ground beneath, causing it to stick up partially. When inspected nothing came of it.

I need some advise, do I continue to snow ball or save for more liquid $$ to have 6+months living expenses?

For reference, I am the sole provider for my family (Husband+ two small children). 

$16,000 Liquid cash (about 4.5 months living, maybe more if we needed to start cutting spending)  
$2,900- $300/month (car, 3.5% rate)  
$12,000- $509/month (Min payment $309, increased to $509-home remodel and stupid spending, 12% rate)  
$5,000- $85/Month (student loan, 6.5% rate)  
$25,000- $180/Month (student Loan, 6% rate)

personalfinance,"Here is my situation, forgive me for the length:    

One of my larger private loans, currently at 32k (principal was 20k) just went into default. I was trying to make payments, and make most of my yearly salary due to snow, but we had an unusually warm winter and I lost a lot of income, COVID hasn't helped either. I was trying to negotiate a more manageable payment with my original servicers (NCT) but fell behind. I have a secure job, which I took an initial pay cut for but my salary will increase yearly. I have minimal savings (basically just an emergency fund if something happens), working on this. No other assets to speak of.    

I already did some reading on people with similar situations posted here, and tried to take that advice, but I'm still unsure of some things or what the best path to take is. My credit is already shot, tho I have been trying to repair it, that is the least of my concerns. What I would like to avoid is wage garnishment.    

My other big concern, which I cannot find a clear answer for is: can they take my car? I took out a car loan for $5000 which is currently down to about $3500. I was initially hesitant to do this but I started a new job within the last 2 years that requires me to have a reliable vehicle and after much deliberation I figured putting down some money now to make sure I keep this job will help me better pay these loans off in the future. It may also be worth noting that i haven't been late on any of my car payments, not sure if that matters.    

I have spoken with the debt collectors (Transworld) twice over 2 weeks and they are willing to settle the debt at 18k if I pay the lump sum (which I cant), OR the agent said he could turn it into a 2 year payment plan which comes out to $750 a month which is still WAY more than I can afford currently. I work any instance of overtime I can get, but due to the unsteady shifts it is hard to find a second job. The client then offered to stretch it to a 5 year settlement, bringing the payments to about $250 a month. Still very high for me, my pay kind of fluctuates, some months I could maybe do this, and others it would be hard. Either way it would stretch me uncomfortably thin, and something about a 5 year settlement with a debt collector makes me a little uneasy, though I guess the original terms of the loan were already very severe.    

I told him I would need a couple days to think this over before making a decision. He also suggested making some small payments ($50-100 a month) as a sign of good faith in my favor when a settlement negotiation came around again. I want to be in good faith but as I have read here making payments like that can be pointless and a waste. Also, based on some advice I've read, I told him I had about $1500 that i would be able to settle with right now (obviously extremely low) but that I live check to check currently and thats the most I could do at the moment. He told me that he couldn't settle for that (obviously) and they are standing firm at 18k. I'm hoping he could eventually come down. I am not sure what the best move to make here is.    

What are the chances they will come down in price in settlement? Should I just pay the $250 for for 5 years and live on thin ice? What are the chances of a lawsuit and wage garnishment? And can they take my car? Any and all advice is much appreciated. Thank you.    

TL;DR My private loan of 32k defaulted, I don't care about my credit, but I don't want my wage garnished or my car seized.",What should I do with defaulted student loan?

personalfinance,"Hey everyone! I am a recently unemployed data analyst looking to take advantage of my downtime by getting my Master's degree started. I have 4+ months emergency funds backed up in savings and a few other investments I could liquidate if needed to pad the fund up to 6+ months. Unemployment benefits are currently more than enough to cover my bills, and I will be adding part of the biweekly disbursement into emergency fund going forward.

With the summer section starting next week, the total tuition and fees comes out to about $3.5k, which I can pay in two installments that I could more or less cover with surplus unemployment benefit.

I currently have $1k left in undergrad loans at 3.4% but they are at 0% temporarily due to the CARES act. I was thinking that taking out graduate unsubsidized loans is the best option, considering I can pay by September with 0% interest, and use the unemployment disbursement surplus to further pad my emergency fund in case an emergency of any sort happens between now and September.

Is this the right move or should I just pay tuition now?

Additional info: I have paid my current loans off aggressively until now, but the two open accounts are older than my car loan so I wanted to keep them open to keep my credit score up (currently at 800+ credit score). I'm actively job searching, getting more interviews while businesses are starting to hire again so I don't see any issue landing a position within the next month or two. The graduate program compliments my career path and will help advance my career further and bring in a higher salary.

We have been paying on the house for almost 8 years as of this November. Our current mortgage on our $239,500 house is a 30 year fixed at 3.5% interest. We pay $1450/month including escrow.

$4000 in closing costs

personalfinance,"ETA: I have an emergency fund covering home and mortgage expenses that was prioritized over paying off the cards. The sum of $4,296.44 has been set aside specifically for my credit cards but I'm at a loss of if I should put it towards an uncertain professional trip in September or pay the cards off. I hope that clarifies things

I am not looking for comments on 'well you should've saved up before committing to a trip' - I had an opportunity to take a discounted writer's retreat with several writers and publishers, and wanted to take advantage of it. Before the pandemic started, this would have been paid for completely. But then a pandemic happened. So I'm only looking for advice/what other people in similar situations are doing with the uncertainty of trips later this year. Thank you in advance :)

Every March, we receive our employee profit share bonus. This year was no different. But no joking, the day the first half of the profit share bonus came in, we went into quarantine lockdown and life just went crazy.

I stopped prioritizing putting the money away for my retreat in July, anticipating that it would likely be cancelled, and instead focused on making sure everything else was covered -- Three months of mortgage payments, four months of payments on my furnace/ac replacement, and four months of payments on my utilities and associated home bills.

We're 11 weeks in just about, and I'm taking a look at my credit cards. I opted instead of sending a bulk payment on most of these, to make sure I'm paying over minimum each month should the worse happen and I would need the money for something else in this uncertain situation, as the CC companies put the \[less than ideal\] forgiveness and assistance programs in. Murphy's law, right? (I had met the first tier of my emergency fund goals, the next tier was for car repairs/replacement, and so on)

1. Discover - $8,000 - **$2,837.80 budgeted for payments each month**
2. Capital One - $2,318.93 - **$690.06 budgeted for payments each month**
3. Capital One - $3,137.35 - **$768.58 budgeted for payments each month**

**Again, the reason why I have those budgets there is just in case that money needed to re-routed to a major emergency such as job loss or the world just going to hell.**

**But now we're getting into Week 11 and my job is currently stable (medical billing processing) and the company has taken steps to ensure that we're well and taken care of. While nothing is ever 100% certain, there have been no indicators in my rumor mill company that things are looking down. Business is on the upswing actually.**

So with that ""security"", I'm taking a look at my credit cards and the trip in September.

* I'm supposed to go to a week in Ireland in September. While the flight was cancelled for the original date in July, so far the rescheduled tour hasn't been cancelled. I need to pay for a flight and some other miscellaneous travel expenses. **Instead of paying off one credit card, should I take the money budgeted for my credit cards and put it towards the trip so I know that this is taken care of, and if the trip doesn't happen, then I can put it back towards the credit cards?**
* Should I go ahead and take the money budgeted for card #1 and pay off Card #2 completely?

I feel a bit crippled with indecision here because of how much uncertainty there is. The trip is Labor Day week, so I'll have to book flights in July, and it's already coming up on June. I hate this uncertainty, I hate the idea of this trip being cancelled, as it is a fantastic opportunity for my writing.

personalfinance,"Hi,

I made a lot of money from cryptocurrencies very quickly, I was young and stupid and doubled down and just lived off of my credit cards in 2017/2018. I stopped accepting paychecks in FIAT currency, just everything in crypto. I reinvested all my stable Bitcoin and ETH profits into ICOs after I got too greedy. The defining moment was when I saw I sold early by a few weeks, happy with only a profit of $1,000 off $3,000 that I made within a few days. Had I kept my investment, that $3K would have been worth over $1M. After that, I was hoping for anything to take my $100K to the $1M mark.

And then everything crashed. Most of my very risky ICO investments turned into worthless, -99% tokens. I suddenly had bills to pay, couldn't afford rent and didn't want to sell my fancy new stuff. I upgraded my lifestyle too quickly, to match up with everybody else around me making 10x more than me. Some of my friends made $500K+ easily. I realized later I was stupid, but panic sold my watches and clothes too late. I only was able to pay off like $15K of debt, in a country where the average person makes that in a year... (Poland).

My parents helped me pay off an additional $10K and sent me $10-15K more. But it wasn't enough. In Poland, all my debts combined are close to $50K. I will most likely move out of the country, back to America as I'm unable to pay off anything. I make like... $300 a month now. And haven't made anything in 2019, without my parents help I'd have been homeless. In America, it's not good either. Around $17K of debt, and growing.. with fees. Here I had to change my phone number 4x after the debt collectors chased me, changed my addresses multiple times and sold literally everything. I now have a few bags of clothes, my laptop, my phone and I'm always just barely scraping by. $50K is enough to buy a house here.. and I owe that, unable to afford groceries sometimes. Ironically, the pandemic didn't really affect me that much since I'm already poor as hell and earn my small income online anyways.

My credit score used to be 732 and I had Amex Platinum, now I owe money to 4 American banks, 1 Polish bank and never was able to pay off even my phone and office lease (I used to have an office lease). I also owe around $1,500 for unpaid traffic tickets, speeding tickets, etc. that I haven't been able to pay off for the past few years here.

personalfinance,"Hey, folks. My fiancée and I are going into our 3rd year of law school. Assuming covid doesn’t destroy these plans later, we currently have law firm jobs lined up and we’ll be making about $170k combined ($100k me, $70k her). I will have about $100k in student loans come time to repay, and she will have $0 in loans. Neither of us have any other debt. We’re both in our mid-20s. 

I’ve done a budget breakdown of a couple different hypotheticals, all of which work out fine in the long term. But I am a little torn on how to proceed with my loans. Either:

1. 3-year plan: Pay $2500+/mo (+ any bonuses or raises) and pay off in roughly 3 years. Contribute roughly $15k toward 401k and Roth IRA (obviously meeting the employer match on 401k in the process).

2. 5-year plan: Pay significantly less (I can’t quite recall the figure; maybe $1900/mo) and pay off in roughly 5 or 6 years. Any bonuses and raises would go toward student loans. Max out 401k and Roth IRA.


The Dave Ramsey folks out there will say not to contribute anything more than the match to retirement before those student loans are gone. I’m not a big fan of this idea because it leaves sooooo much money on the table. I am inclined to go with plan #2 just because I think by the time I’m 65 or so, I’m going to be really glad I prioritized retirement over loans, when in both hypos the loans have been long gone at that point.

I also realize that paying off in 3 years frees up thousands in income to use for other things sooner, like retirement. Also the bonuses and raises (which are more modest in our city than in NYC or DC  firms) would make it likely that repayment is shorter than 3 or 5 years. 

What do you think? I sort of think both are fine, but I’m inclined toward #2 with the intention of increasing loan payments as my salary grows.",Aggressively pay off student loans or aggressively build retirement?

personalfinance,"I'll try to keep this brief since I just wrote all this out and it somehow got deleted. Please ask any follow ups needed. 

Current Mortgage- 75k 30yr fixed at 5.6%. I'm ten years in and have 60k left to pay. Monthly payment is $640/month. I also took out a 35k HELOC on the home last year but I've only used 6k and still have a 5k balance. Monthly payment on the HELOC is $100/month bringing my total housing costs per month to $740.

&amp;#x200B;

Refinance options 1 and 2: both standard refis with 2k in closing costs built in.

Option 1- 62k mortgage over 15yrs @ 2.8%. Total interest paid about 14.5k, new monthly payment would be almost exactly what I pay now. This option would shave 5yrs off of my current timeline and save me a lot of money in interest while keeping my payment basically the same. 

Option 2- 62k mortgage over 20yrs @ 3.1%. Total interest paid would be about 21.5k, new monthly would be about $567. This option would keep me on my current timeline of 20 more years while saving me about $70/month and quite a bit on interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3 would be a cash out refi taking 25k out of my equity and would have 3k in closing costs built in and is as follows:

Option 3- 88k mortgage over 20yrs @ 3.1% with 25k cash back. Total interest paid: $30.5k, new monthly payment would be $715 which would be more than the $640 I'm paying now but because I would be using 5k of the cash out to get rid of the HELOC which is $100/month I would actually be saving about $25/month on total housing loans. This option would also keep me on my current 20 yr timeline.

So I know the question is why not just jump on the 2.8% and be done with it? Well, we like our house but we don't love it. My wife wants to move but I'm trying to convince her to stay because our house is so affordable compared to what we would be paying if we moved. All the houses that fit our needs are in the 200k ballpark (LCOL area so a 200k house is pretty damn nice around here) so I'd really rather stay in our current home that I got for a steal back in '10. The problem is to convince her to give up on a new house we have absolutely got to do full scale renovation of the rear of the house which includes the kitchen and main bathroom. This renovation is going to be at least 50k so I'm going to have to borrow a portion of the costs one way or another. My thinking with the cash out refi is that it's a chance to get  money that I know I'll need to borrow in the future anyway at a 3.1% rate over a 20yr period whereas if I do the standard refi and just take out another HELOC down the road when we need it I'll be paying a higher, variable rate over a shorter time period thus making that same borrowed money much more expensive. 

So if anyone can point out any obvious things I'm missing or tell me why I'm being dumb not just jumping on the 2.8% rate I'm all ears. I've been going back and forth between the option for the last 24hrs and I need to make a call.","[Refinance] Hey all, looking for some opinions on my refinance options.

personalfinance,"[NY - COOPERATIVE APT] Refinance Mortgage Issues

Hello,
I have a complex situation with my refinancing and would like to know if this happened to anyone who lives in a cooperative apartment.

I applied with my current mortgage lender for a refinance about two months ago. Three weeks ago I was notified by the bank that my application is denied because underwriting reviewed my cooperative budget for 2020 and noted that the operating budget was a negative. I live in a cooperative where the flip tax is really high so they have a lot of reserves/capital funds but the operating expenses are not positive. There’s pros and cons to this as they don’t increase our maintenance by very much yearly. Anyway, so long story short, I thought I was denied for the entire refinance process and that was the end of it. However, just two days ago, the bank called me and told me my refinance application has been conditionally approved. I reached out to the mortgage advisor but they haven’t told me the reason why underwriting decided to approve my application after denying it. 

I have mixed feelings about the whole process now as I was disappointed to find out underwriting considered my refinance a risk due to my cooperative finances. Yet, I don’t know how to proceed/fee about this now that they conditionally approved me but would not state the reasons why they originally denied my application and came back to approve it.

personalfinance,"Hi all,

I am trying to determine whether it’s in my best interest to apply for a banking loan right now. Here is the backstory:

In 2019 I moved which lead to surprising financial hardship as I expected to find a lot of freelance work but it took a while to get going and the rates for the work I was in were lower ($25 to $18 avg per hour) than I anticipated in my new home. I moved to be with my partner so no regrets. It meant that over the year I acquired the expected credit card debt that comes with continuing a lifestyle you no longer can afford. 

At the end of 2019 I landed a job comparable to my previous income and have been aggressively paying down the debt. My bank, which rejected me for a loan in 2019 which is partially why the CC debt is high, sent me a mailer saying I was pre-approved for a loan, and advertised a solid low 6.9% apr rate.

I think it is in my best interest, now that my income is stable, to apply for this loan and pay off a lot of my CC Debt, and just commit to making loan repayments on a 5 year plan.

If my job remains stable for 2 years, I am projecting through google sheets, I can pay off the CC Debt. 

So what’s better? Get the loan now, and have some flexible income knowing the long term monthly payments are low and whatever, or keep scrimping and saving knowing I can be completely debt free in 2 years.

personalfinance,"Hello! I'm currently 22 years old and I am trying to build a Roth IRA for a long term retirement. I don't plan on retiring until 2060 or later. I am hesitant to start putting money into the IRA because I am not sure if it is better to save up money to meet the minimum investment for an index fund or just go ahead with buying ETFs until it is time to retire. I was also hoping to start soon and take advantage of the low prices due to the COVID-19 situation. I've been constantly reading and decided that Vanguard ETFs or index funds may be what I am leaning more towards. Most of my information I have gotten about investing has been from Graham Stephan's youtube videos and other websites. Here are my questions:

1) Would I lose money in just doing ETFs for the long term instead of doing an index fund in my Roth IRA?

2)Is a three fund portfolio the best way of building money for retirement? I keep hearing mixed reviews about it and target date funds.

3) When I see the difference in share prices from the ETF and Index Funds, I noticed that the index funds offered shares at a much lower price than an ETF. Is this why more people are going with index funds? If so, is it much better just to save up until I am able to afford the index funds? I only currently have 6,000 dollars to invest into my Roth IRA. I would need another 3,000 in order to get the third fund for my portfolio.

4) For my Three fund portfolio, I was hoping to focus on  VTI, VXUS, and BND or the Index fund equivalents VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX respectively. Is this too diversified? Do I need to do better with reducing the diversification? Are these ETFs/index funds not good for my long term Roth IRA retirement plan? What are better options and why?

5) Considering my age and time until retirement, would it better to be aggressive with my investments and have them more towards the stocks instead of bonds? If so, what would be appropriate percentages for each of the three funds. Would I have to change the percentages as I grow older?

6) Looking at the average annual returns for the international stocks VTIAX and VXUS, I noticed they have been really low mostly in the 1-2%. Is there any reason to invest in these or should I focus my investments in other locations? 

7) from what I understand with reading articles and viewing videos, it is important to have an average annual return of 7% to help grow your money in the IRA by a significant amount. Does this mean if I had 4% in my US stocks, 1% in international, and 2% in bonds this would equal up to that 7% I need for my Roth IRA per year? I understand that some years would be lower and some higher. I was just wondering if the returns from each of the three funds were cumulative for the Roth IRA.

I probably have around 9X credits toward a CE degree but given my coursework began around 2010, I imagine those credits will slowly expire. On top of that, I really don't remember anything as far as coursework goes and I never had a vested interest in CE. It was something forced onto me via familial pressure.

My current situation has me making 55k/yr in a Tier 2 IT Support/Project Implementer role. My employer took a gamble on me 2 years ago due to my lack of qualifications, where I started at 35k/yr as an entry level HDS and I've managed to exceed expectations. My biggest problem is I don't have a degree nor any actual certifications. Everything I know I've learned from personal experience, tinkering around, and on the job.

I spoke to my manager about upward mobility and he basically told me that as much as he knows I'm capable of being able to do the work, they prefer the more advanced roles have the certifications needed to do the job so they can justify to clients that our team is entirely certified. My current role doesn't require any such thing.

He told me that if I did manage to get relevant certs (CCNA, AWS, and/or Microsoft, etc.) he can basically get me onto the respective team with ease and I can expect a 10-15k bump in salary. I believe him given that he's advocated for me to his bosses and got me a 20k bump over 2 years.

The problem is, I work in a very suburban, bordering rural, location and this is not where I want to spend the next several years of my life. I was hoping to move into a more city like / downtown location where I don't have to rely on a car and I can have more of a social life. But I fear my paper qualifications are severely lacking and I'd never be able to get a job elsewhere.

I just don't know if going back to school makes sense in this situation. I've tried it twice in my early-mid 20s and have dropped out both times and really I wouldn't even be searching for a job in my degree field. My other option was to buckle down and study, as much as I resent it, to get the certs required to get a new position.

Do I go in debt again to try and continue school for a degree that very well might not help me or spend a reasonable amount that is still affordable on resources to help me acquire certifications and let the experience carry me?

personalfinance,"Hi /r/personalfinance. Throwaway for reasons.

We (wife and I) own 2 cars. 2016 SUV and a 2007 sedan, both are paid off. Our only debt is the credit card balance we pay off monthly and our mortgage. Combined we make roughly 170k/year. Sedan is 110k miles, SUV is 50k miles. But the sedan is a car known for its issues (Chrysler Sebring). So we are just sort of waiting for that bomb to go off, so to speak.

We currently put in about 1200/year into the Sebring for maintenance and repairs. Far cheaper than a car payment.

We haven't really been saving for a new car until just recently since we knew our days with the Sebring are likely numbered. And now there are a lot of 0% financing deals.

We just started saving $800/month for a new car (current car expenses are $200/month), but with the deals we can get in the car I want (truck. Because I'm stupid. I don't need a truck. I work at a desk. But we camp, and kayak, so I think it might be worth it, and we will likely inherit a camper that needs some towing capacity in a couple years), for total costs less than the $1000/month we were saving/putting into the new car. With registration fees high in our area the total cost for a brand new car, 0% for 5 years, with nothing down (eeek!), 38k loan + registration + insurance + gas = $930

Which is what we are currently saving and/or putting into.

I know the answer is, ""No. That's dumb. You don't know what will happen 2 years from now. If you lose your job, you're in a world of hurt. Keep driving the Sebring until it stops working and save in the meantime. Its a far better decision."" 

But I think I need to hear that from other people. Because my wife is so amazing she says, ""Look. We both know we don't need a truck. But I want you to have the car you want. Its going to be your car. If its a truck you want, get a truck."" Which can be dangerous.

**OPTION 2:**

We just wait until the Sebring dies, and but a 2 year old truck with 30k miles on it when that happens and when it does we will have more money saved up for it.",Zero Percent on a car note? Lots of good deals. Not sure if we should pull the trigger.

personalfinance,"Started 2018 with excellent credit, very little card debt and a healthy emergency savings. A lifetime of responsibility and sacrificing where appropriate in the name of a better financial situation... All of that was sacrificed to expand business and in doing so for some time had to operate at a loss- lowered my pay to less than what would cover my bills, used credit cards to keep myself and the business afloat, else the alternative was laying two people off. Things took longer than expected but worked out eventually and is finally paying off- gave raises all around, hired more employees and began rolling out health insurance benefits. Mission accomplished! ^^(For ^^the ^^business ^^at ^^least.)

The damage to my finances and credit has been done, dropping me to a ""fair"" 630's score and adding about $50,000 of credit card debt, showing credit utilization at 88%. Payments were missed or were short along the way in the worst times, so all have high APR and as a result are charged about $800/mo in interest alone between the 3 cards. 

Amex $24000 at 29.99% APR
Citi $15000 at 17.49%
Bank business credit card $10000 at 19.24%

My family of 4 is turning into 6, with twins coming in about 5 months. Our house that has about $100,000 of equity is too small so will need to move- not mandatory immediately but would help a ton not trying to have twin newborns in the same room as a 2 year old after moving them from bedside bassinets to cribs after a few months. Fortunately property values shot up after buying 4 years ago, so in selling we'll have the 20% down payment on a bigger place right away.

We are uninsured in USA, so will be looking forward to the hospital bill after delivery and likely a week long stay at the hospital for my wife as she had issues with high blood pressure following delivery last time. At least there, we get discounts for being uninsured and could work out a payment plan... not ideal, but should this even be on the radar and not bother saving for it? If interest is tagged to it, it's certainly far lower than the credit cards.

There is about $8000 a month left after expenses now and this month chipped $2500 off each card and put $500 into 2019's Roth IRA as I had not yet contributed anything.

Current idea unless you gurus say otherwise, for June-October is to put $7000 each month toward the cards equally until total credit utilization is at 30% or less, with about $700/mo going toward readying for babies, and small bits toward 2019 and 2020 Roth IRA because I'm 34 and have no retirement savings yet.

The aim and hope is that as credit utilization goes back down to normal 30% the credit score will improve to acceptable levels for the needed bridge loan and new mortgage come move time. When we got the current house we're in my score was in the 730's, and at least am not naive to think it'll return to this in 5 short months. Is this the optimal route to improving the credit score as much as possible, or do I even have any hope of improving it to mortgage-approval levels this year?

My advisor has sent me an email requesting that I sign a document which will allow a new broker/dealer access to my account information These two pieces of communication have left me very confused. Before I didn't think I had a firm grasp on the intricacies of the account. Now I realize I have very little understanding at all.

As far as I can tell, there are five entities involved in the management of my account (not including myself): my advisor's ""Financial Consultation"" company, a ""Registered Investment Advisory Firm"", the mutual fund my 403b is based on, the broker/dealer, and a credit union. I've been trying to figure out what each of these bodies is responsible for, with varying success. As far as I can tell:

*Financial Consultants* \- A group that provides the advisor I interact with. They allow me to make moves related to my account and provide advice on said moves. They oversee the mutual fund?

*Registered Investment Advisory Firm* \- I don't know. Maybe it has to do with the fact that they're registered? All of these websites are incredibly vague.

*Mutual Fund* \- The sum of the investments of myself and a large group of strangers.

*Broker/Dealer* \- The people who actually do the buying and selling of stocks.

*Credit Union* \- Where the money is actually stored.

I have two questions. First: is any of that remotely correct? Second: should I be at all worried about the change of brokers, or should I just sign the document and forget about it? Any corrections and/or advice is greatly appreciated! I would normally ask my advisor these questions, but I'm worried about getting a biased answer since they're the ones that are making the change.

Initially we bought it about 3 years ago at a rate of 4.25% for 30 years with a monthly pyment of about 2450. About 3-6 months ago we refinanced and brought it down to like 3.75% and we ended up saving about 200 a month(I forget all the exact numbers) but we still just lay 2450 to pay more principle each month. Anyway, rates are lower now and I am wondering:

Is it fine to refinance again so soon or will it look bad on my credit? 

The way they said they could handle the closing costs is that it would basically be like a monthly payment, in that my old loan would close, and usually you have a month before the payments begin. They said that the costs would basically be the same as my monthly payment. So instead of that 30 days of no payment I would be paying as if I still had my mortgage. So is that an alright way to do it? If we planned on moving in say 2 years would that still count as losing money on the refinance, or is it not a problem since the fees are not in addition to a monthly payment? In my mind, I would hve paid that month anyway, so is it really costing me anything or no?

I am 29 yrs old living in the midwest, married, and still renting an apartment. Me and my wife have $60,000 in savings. I've read across many forums that it's a good rule of thumb to have about 6 months worth of salary sitting in savings in case of job loss or medical expenses. Im sure with $60,000 sitting in savings me and the wife could both be unemployed for a few years before the money ran out. Ideally both of us would never be unemployed that long so im starting to think it makes more sense to put some money into a roth IRA or some other type of investments. We both currently have 401k's through our jobs. I have never really invested money before outside of the 401k. I had thought a 401k and the value of my future home would be enough for investments for retirement when we are older.

We are thinking of possibly putting $20,000 as down payment and the rest of our money would be for savings in case of unemployment or medical problems.

I currently have $7k in savings and I’ve begun working 2 steady full time jobs. My first and primary job I make $3496 monthly and my second job I make between $3300 and $3400 monthly. Both jobs have the possibility of overtime sometimes but between both jobs I’ve been sticking to my normal 40hrs each and work OT here and there. My absolute bare minimum monthly expenses come to about ~$1500 a month give or take. 

I’ve been looking at low interest credit cards to transfer the balance, I believe nfcu has a no balance transfer fee and 0% interest for 12 months. Would that be a good idea? Should I just spend a large chunk of my savings and pay off the capital one card? Or should I just make larger monthly payments with everything as it? Now that I have the second job, I feel that I can aggressively tackle my debit but ideally, I would feel more comfortable keeping the savings as is and even trying to add to it. 

A big motivator for me is to one day buy a house and although I know I’m a long ways away, I’m super determined now so any insight or advice would be much appreciated.",Best plan of action

personalfinance,"We are in the process of selling our home and buying another (less expensive) one. We will be living with family during the gap (no more than 2 months). We also happen to have a decent amount of credit card debt.

Current Credit Debt Situation:

We have been successfully paying down debt, but the interest is killing us.

Income: 165k/year

Current Debt

Card 1:
35k balance
19.99% rate
 
Card 2:
15k balance
15% rate
 
Total: ~50k

Our minimum payments are around $1200/month. We have been paying an extra 300-800 a month, sometimes more, depending on other things that come up during the month. We never miss payments and always pay extra.

Solution 1:

Take out a 401(k) loan at 3.25% now as a debt consolidation loan, pay off cards, put former minimum payment money plus the extra we had been paying to pay down the debt toward 401(k) payback.

Solution 2:

Use proceeds from house sale (expected to be approx. 70-80k net) to pay off debt, then take a 401(k) at 3.25% loan for 50k to use as a down payment.

Solution 3:

Apply for a personal loan/debt consolidation loan at approximately 12% for 5 years.

My concerns are the timing of this and which option is best, from a lenders point of view. Should we take out the loan before we sell the home or after? If after, do we do it before we buy the new home or after?

I am concerned about our rate for the new mortgage with the credit debt on my DTI. But I am also worried about taking out a 401(k) loan right before buying a house. Won’t the lender see a large deposit of 50k and then an outflow of the same? I’m worried that will ring alarm bells. I am also concerned that if I take a personal loan it will (1) count as a hard credit pull and (2) not reduce my DTI, thus still negatively impacting my credit score.

A few things to get out of the way upfront:

-	We cannot stay with family long term and pay off debt.

-	We are going to sell our current home and buy a new (less expensive) one. This isn’t going to change so please keep that in mind.

-	We are going to consolidate the credit debt somehow, whether it be with a 401(k) loan or personal loan.

As I said earlier, we are no longer accruing debt and have not for a while. These debts were largely from a couple of emergency situations we had earlier in life and home improvements. We were ignorant at the time and instead of saving for the improvement we threw it on the credit card.

I may or may not stay with the company. So I called the benefits people, and they said there was nothing I could do to withdraw my pension and put it in an account where I could control it.

I've got ~$50k saved up in my Fidelity account, and I'm not sure whether to leave it where it is, or transfer it to TransAmerica. I had a mix of 401k and ROTH, but I can't seem to find the amount in each in Fidelity's portal. It's probably 65/35, respectively, if I had to guess.

All I was doing with that amount was putting it into an S&amp;P 500 index fund, and that's all I was planning on with my new account. It looks like the fee at Fidelity is 0.015%, while TransAmerica has 0.01%

personalfinance,"Around March of 2019 I went and had some dental work done, and today, over a year later they sent me a text saying I owed them $333.13 for dental work. At the time, money being an issue I asked them specifically how much it would cost. I did use my insurance I had at the time. They gave me an amount, I agreed , had the work performed, and paid the amount after they finished.

I called to ask what I owed for and the lady claims they have been sending invoices to an address I haven't lived at in almost 10 years. Basically whatever amount the insurance was supposed to cover was an assumption and they did not get that amount. I asked why it took a year to attempt to call or even text me, and to do so in the midst of a pandemic. Her answer was basically a repeat that they had been sending invoices. I have lived at my current address for 3 years, I can't remember if they asked to update my information when I went in last year.

personalfinance,"Hi /r/personalfinance! I’m a soon to be new grad in a MCOL city and have been fortunate enough to be able to accept a full-time offer in a fairly COVID-proof industry. Recently, I’ve been toying with the idea of splurging a little and purchasing a performance car that I’ve been dreaming about for the last couple years (6-12 months from now). Ideally, I’d like to buy a 3-4 year old example at the bottom of the initial depreciation curve and am hoping to pay a maximum of $45k. It would likely be my only car, but would primarily be used during evenings and weekends.

Now, I know that conventional PF wisdom says that I should probably just shuck all my money into ETFs and retire at 40 instead, but FIRE is not something I’m personally interested in. I understand that buying a used performance car probably isn’t the best use of money, but how bad of an idea is it really?

Here’s the gist of how things stand financially:

- Early 20s w/ graduate degree in STEM field.
- Living in a MCOL city in the Mid-Atlantic.
- No outstanding debt, 750+ credit score.
- ~$225k annual liquid income + some hard-to-value amount of equity in a private company.
- ~$110k in savings, held in cash and mutual funds.
- ~$10k paid off older car, which I’d probably trade-in on the purchase.

I’m currently living fairly frugally with roommates, but I’m looking to move closer to work soon and would estimate future recurring expenses to be less than $3k a month:

- Rent + Parking + Utilities: $2000/mo
- Gas + Car Insurance: $250/mo
- Car Maintenance: $200/mo
- Groceries + Restaurants: $300/mo
- All Other Recurring Subscriptions: $55/mo


With that being said, I have a few questions for those on /r/pf with more life experience:

1. For those of you who splurged a bit to buy a car you really wanted (especially if you were in your 20s), what was your ownership experience like? Looking back, was it worth it?
2. If I were to go ahead with the purchase, would it be more advantageous to pay cash for the entire vehicle or finance some portion of the purchase (~$10k) to help build credit?
3. For those of who’ve purchased vehicles not noted for their reliability, did you buy an extended warranty? Was it worth it?

so i used to have 30k credit card debt. last year i started my debt free journey, and currently i am down to 23k.

i am a single, 29 yr old and i work as a flight attendant.

with what's happening right now, with the pandemic and all the uncertainty, ive been feeling really really down a lot lately. i used to be so optimistic with my goal to become debt free before i turn 30 but now, i am starting to get so overwhelmed again and i'm scared.

with the state of the airline industry right now, tremendous decrease in flights and way too many flight attendants, everyone at work are expecting furloughs to happen soon, like around October and September. this has brought me so much anxiety and im doing my very best to keep it all together. 

my credit card companies do offer like a deferment options wherein they wont require me to pay for a few months and fees are waived but interest will still accrue and i didnt do that. while i still can, i want to continue making payments still, and what i did instead is asked them if the could lower my interest rates which some of them did, by 1 or 2 percent less.

i have 5 remaining c/c balances with an average of 18-22% apr 😔 i know

i am overwhelmed. i live alone, i am single, and ive been feeling so alone not just with my goals but also in this time of crisis. i wouldn't say i am depressed and i don't want to spiral into that but lately, i just been feeling so not myself and if being completely honest, defeated. i could lose my job anytime soon, i don't have a degree so i could have something to fall back on, my family also have their own struggles so i can't depend on them for assistance. 

i was following dave ramsey's plan and though it's been really hard, since last year, i worked my ass off by working more hours so i could have more money to pay towards my debt and now i am slowly realizing that my life is kind of sad. this debt and my goal to get out of it, really affected my social life and in this time of quarantine, i am starting to realize the effects of my financial situation. i don't have anyone because i didn't cherish my relationships and friendships enough because i was constantly stressed out from having so much debt. 

just today, and i never considered this when i embarked on this journey, i thought maybe i should just file for bankruptcy. will this be a good idea? i don't have any properties like cars or houses or expensive things. i don't know exactly what's gonna happen when one files for bankruptcy but i feel so hopeless and i just feel live giving in and giving up. what are the pros and cons of doing this?

my other option also is, right now, my company allows us to take out a loan from our 401k, like the cares act loan due to this pandemic. i could take out up to $16,000 with just 4% interest rate which is way way better than my current rates. also if i take out this loan, they wont require payments til January of 2021. i was thinking maybe i could use this money to pay off my credit cards and it will save me a lot of money in interest charges.

Okay so here's the deal.  I'm 24, living in Chicago, and just got out of a long-term relationship with the person that I live with.  I'm on the hunt for a 6/1 or 7/1 move-in to a new place, and am trying to figure out if I can swing a 1-bedroom.  I don't want to move into a studio, and I have a couple of options for moving into a vacant room in 2-3 br places, but I would really like to live on my own.

Now for the nitty gritty.  I'm currently paying $600/mo in rent, and have been paying that comfortably for the last 4 years.  1-br places in my area cost $800 minimum, and $900 before you get to places that I'm confident wouldn't be vaguely shitty.  I'm a gig worker (instacart, uber, grubhub, you name it I'm on it), and during the pandemic I've been able to keep my earnings at $770/wk.  Before the pandemic, that was earned in 30-40 hours over 3 (sometimes 4) days.  Since the pandemic, that has been earned in 35-45 hours over 3-5 days, depending.  So it's gotten harder, but not intolerably so.

I have $13,000 in the bank (fluctuating by about $2000 as bills are paid and direct deposits come in).  That has all been accumulated since I emptied my savings to buy a $9,000 car cash down two years ago.  I'm paying $260/mo to myself as a ""car loan,""  and will be completely paid back by the end of May 2021.  These savings currently earn about $25/mo in interest. There is also $7,000 in a 401(k), although that is no longer being contributed to because I left that job.  

Other major monthly expenses are:
Food: $200
Health Insurance: $162
Student loans: $189
Acting expenses (career related): $100
Cat: $50
Gas and upkeep: $250
Personal purchases and fun stuff: $150 (pre-covid)
I haven't included utilities because that varies widely from apt to apt and also I've always split those expenses so I don't really know.

I know those numbers don't completely add up, but I usually find that I have spent about $2000 every month (not including the car ""loan.""

It's a little hard to figure out what my baseline monthly income is because since I quit my hospital job in October there wasn't a month that didn't include some variety of being out of town (not normal), but I would put it around $3000 before tax.  (When I do go out of town I make up the difference by pulling from my vacation ""envelope,"" but that's not included in my gross income.)

When I lay it all out like that it feels like I should have the room to play with an extra $200-$300 in rent, but I always feel like my finances are really tight somehow, and I'm worried that unexpected expenses of living alone like having to pay the whole of the utilities, all of the toilet paper, etc is going to add up a lot faster than I think it will.

I don't have a monthly budget planned out in advance, but I have a very extensive spreadsheet and never spend impulsively.  I'm very organized with my money, but am having a hard time figuring out whether I can do this or not.

So, Reddit, what do you think?  Should I just go for it as is?  Is this a bad idea right now because pandemic and everything is uncertain?

Recently, one of my roomates backed out of a great apartment.

I recently went to purchase a new vehicle. When the dealership checked my credit, they noticed that my car loan is listed as paid off, in full (but it isn't - I still owe $3K). The account is now closed with the payment status reported as ""Pays account as agreed"", date of last payment is 12/1/2017.

It's like this on every credit report I have pulled. The car dealer asked me if my current car was repossessed, because that's what it looks like on paper. However, I still have physical ownership of the car, it was just at a shop waiting to see if repairs were really worth it or not (they aren't). I ended up not getting the car fixed, but I still owe about $3K on it and have continued to make payments on it far past the date of 12/1/17.

I am not sure what this means - do I still owe on this vehicle? At one time (in 2018, not 2017) it had been repossessed but I paid the full amount due to the finance company to get it back and resumed payments as normal, and haven't even noticed this on my credit reports until now. I've driven this car every day (until Covid-19) to and from work, insured it, paid for repairs to it, etc. It is not currently in any collections status, I am current in my online account with them as well, and that's where I can see I still owe money.

How would it affect me if I stopped paying for it, or should I continue to pay it off? Can I apply for the title? Should I request that my credit reports be updated or not? And should I tell this to the finance company, or is it to my benefit to just let it be? I honestly wonder what repercussions could be taken against me if I decided to stop paying the loan they've reported as closed anyway. I don't want the darn thing anyway, but if I could resell it to someone for parts or as a project, that would be nice. It's worth about $900 and the repairs are $3k (and, again, I owe $3k).

personalfinance,"So, A few years back, I got into some credit card debt. Reasons dont matter why at this point, but it happened, I've worked on paying my biggest one off (after getting served the paperwork to sue me), and the other two CCs fell off of my credit report.

The latest letter wants to settle a $2,500 debt for $470.

I use Fidelity as my brokerage and have my current 401k and my stock in there. I'd preferably like to move the old plan over to Fidelity so I can manage everything from one place.

At the time I was in a bind because my landlord was selling the house I rented and I wasn’t super comfortable getting a roommate with my daughter (assuming anyone would even want to house-share with a random toddler). My mortgage is far cheaper than rent is currently in my area so my brother really helped me out with this and I’m eternally grateful. The plan was for me to refinance in a few years and take him off of the loan. He didn’t have any interest in buying a house for himself and was confident that I could make the payments (which I have). I got down payment assistance in the form of an $8k, 30 year interest free bond from the state (WA) that I would have to pay back either when I refinance or at the end of the loan.

He’s unexpectedly gotten the opportunity to buy some property from a family friend for a really sick deal, and I’m worried how co-signing for me will affect him. My understanding is that the monthly payment will factor into his debt to income ratio, and although he doesn’t have any other debts it is still about 30% of his monthly income. I’m fairly confident that I would be able to refinance under my own name now since my income is higher than when I first purchased and I was only slightly below what I needed at the time, but I have no idea how to pay back the down payment assistance.

Hopefully this is the right sub to post my situation. If not, please direct me to the right sub.

I have had my Chase Freedom card for close to 5 years without an incident. Recently, I have been hit with fraudulent charges 3 times in a row and 3rd time perplex me the most.

1. **1st time**: a month ago, I got hit with a fraudulent charge from Netflix.com for $8.99 (not me since I don't have an active plan with Netflix and has never provided them with my credit card info). Earlier that day I used my card on Walmart, at a local grocery store that I frequent, and a CVS store. I reported the charge with Chase and have it reversed.
   1. **Solution:**  Card locked, Card info taken off all e-commerce sites and Chase sent over replacement card which I received a week later. Done and done.
2. **2nd time**: Just last week, I, then with my replacement card, got a text message from Chase Fraud Services about a declined charge for Netflix.com for $15.99 this time. The day before I got this text, again, I used it at my local grocery store and the same CVS store. This time around, I started to suspect there must have been something wrong with the self-check out kiosks at CVS (perhaps a skimmer or security compromise of some sort) because a week earlier, I shopped at the grocery store and nothing happened.
   1. **Solution:** Frustratingly, I locked my card again and Chase automatically sent over a new card since they were the one intercepting the fraudulent charge.
3. **3rd time:**  Just yesterday, I got an email notification from Chase about yet another freaking charge with Netflix.com for $15.99. This time around, they authorized it just like the 1st time (Duh?). But here's the kicker, I haven't even received my new card in the mail yet! 
   1. **Solution:** I called Chase again to reverse the charge and report the issue. Replacement card (another one!) will be expedited to me in 1-2 days. I also updated my [chase.com](https://chase.com) account password.

That 3rd time scared the hell out of me. I could only think of 2 scenarios:

1. Someone got my mail by mistake, opened it and thought ""free money"" and used the card. But then ""why [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) again?"" is what I wondered. If the 1st and 2nd time are related but isolated from the 3rd time, is the [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) charge this time around is just a coincidence?
2. I have been hacked somehow, which begs the question ""how does my card info get leaked when I haven't even received it, activated it and used it anywhere?""

I'm single, 28 and I've been teaching/coaching for 5 years. I've got no debt besides a credit card which is paid in full each month and \~6,800 in student loans which I just applied to have 5K of that forgiven. Between teaching and a few supplemental positions I should make 49-50K. 

I just accepted a teaching job and will be moving back to my home town soon. I was previously renting and I'm wanting to buy a house and put some roots down. My dad owns a construction business in that town and has offered to build me a house at cost on a lot he owns. He estimated this would be 132K but that would be without a yard put in, appliances, etc. This is a great offer for me but following the Dave Ramsey guidelines I'd probably be well overshooting what I can comfortably afford. I was thinking more like 70-80K for a first home. I live in a small rural town \~2K people so housing obviously isn't what it would cost in a big city.

Do I take advantage of very low interest rates and have him build me a home at cost or do I just buy a starter home for 80K (usually an older home from probably the 40's, 50's or 60's) and live there for a while and worry about maintenance costs. I do have around 20K in a roth ira but I'd rather leave that money there and I do have around 11K in a checking account. 

I'd say the best option is just to buy something older for now and upgrade later once I have more of a net but then again rates may climb back up. Another option would be to rent. My parents do have 5 rentals in town but currently all full. Anyways, just bouncing ideas off you.",Buying New vs Used

personalfinance,"I've been working at my employer for about 3 years without a raise or promised bonuses. I have received multiple employee of the month honors and I'm generally well-liked around the office from superiors and colleagues alike. I try to go above and beyond to help my teammates and in general be a servant leader. I'm also the internal face of the company as I regularly MC our weekly meetings and try to improve morale wherever I can.

When COVID hit, we were already into multiple rounds of layoffs for 2020. About 6 weeks ago, our CEO announced that everyone was receiving a sizable pay cut (to his credit, he took a larger pay cut). While I personally believe COVID presented an opportunity for the company to slash pay without completely bombing morale or laying off more folks, I can't actually prove it. The point here is that the company wasn't doing that great before COVID, COVID should actually render our business model MORE viable, and yet the company opted to cut pay and most benefits without any notice.

Fast forward to now: I have a solid, recession-proof job offer for a sizable increase in pay. The company is legit as I have a close friend working there who vouches for the culture and direction of the company. I am taking the job even if my current company makes a crazy offer.

My questions is this: **with an offer in hand, would it be professionally acceptable to demand my COVID backpay and my pre-COVID salary in exchange for the standard two-week notice?**

My thinking is that the employer and I had an agreement that I would work for X amount and they backed out of the agreement without notice. In my opinion, it would have been professionally acceptable for me to refuse the pay cut and resign on the spot, but I'm wondering if the same applies 6 weeks later.

I do want to leave the company on good terms, so I would be willing to work the two weeks at my reduced pay if it meant that I can keep my professional connections. On the other hand, I can start this new job right now for a 30% increase in pay.

personalfinance,"TL;DR - Whole life insurance policy tied to high interest (something like 4.5% over central bank rate) savings account. Fee for insurance component is currently about equal to interest gained. Interest will obviously increase if central rate increases and if more is paid into the account, but the fee (nearly $100) is so high that I think it doesn't become worth it unless both the amount in the account and the central bank rate both increase substantially, in which case better opportunities would probably come up. Am I thinking this through right?

--------

Hi, this post is for my gf. When she was a child her parents set up a 'whole life insurance' policy tied to a savings account. This savings account currently pays something like 5% interest and if the fed (I think) rate ever went up then this savings rate would also go up. The account has over $20k in it.

However, it isn't growing because the monthly fee for the life insurance component is about equal to the monthly interest. In fact, the fee is currently something like $2 more.

In my mind, although the interest rate looks good at face value because the fee is so high the effective interest rate is 0. Even if the fed rate (or whatever the standard the account is tied to) increased by 2-5% the net interest rate would be 1-3% and if the central bank rates did raise like that I expect she could probably find a savings account offering 1-3% anyway. The amount paid if she was to die isn't even that much. The amount of money in the account to make the interest worth it would have to be much higher.

We spoke to the financial advisor holding the account and they very strongly told us she should keep the account and that it was an excellent product. I'm not a financial advisor, but it's currently losing money and at best will increase barely as much as a retail bank after fees while offering very basic life insurance policy.

She unfortunately doesn't have an IRA set up at all and she is also planning on going back to school (expected &lt;$8k cost) and finish her degree in a very employable sector which will mean at least a 4X increase in salary.

We are considering: 

* a) Keeping the account and making payments at least equal to the fee each month. Let the account grow. Also save up for school and start paying into IRA mutual fund account.
* b) Closing the account and use the funds for a combination of school fees and IRA mutual fund account. Maybe put some into a retail mutual fund account with an eye to withdraw in 3-7 years to buy a house.

-If I refi right now to a 15 year term it would be $3447 x 180 months= $620,460 which saves me over $296k and the house would be paid off at age 52.
-In order to come up with the additional ~$700 a month to make the bigger 15 yr payment, I would need to reduce my 401k contributions..... my wife and I both max out our 401k contributions so we are basically saving $40k a year, and our balances seem to have us on track or even ahead of the game with retirement goals. 
-One estimate shows $700/month invested in stocks at 6% annual returns would come out a little under $200k over 15 years....so $296k is greater than  $200k right? Except that the $296k is actually saved over a 30 year period....see how I'm confusing myself lol
-In the long term am I better off contributing the 700 a month tax-deferred into the 401k or should I put it towards the house and why? 
-Another piece of the puzzle is 18 months left on 2 cars at about $820/month. Should I factor this in as well?

personalfinance,"Ppl complain about Zelle in this sub often so I want to share my thoughts on the best practice.   

If you don't know Zelle, consider it as digitally handing ""cash"" to a recipient in person. It's instant and once paid, you have little control over the pmt.  

Never Zelle with a stranger. The common scams occur, when ppl transact with a complete stranger. It's not designed for merchandise pmt because it provides no protection. If a stranger insists on Zelle, simply walk away.   

Another common mistake is just a user error. To send money to a friend/family, you either need to enter the email address or phone number. Occasionally, ppl mistype this and the money is sent to a stranger. Before the transaction, your bank may display the name of the recipient registered at Zelle (BofA does). For example, if I enter a wrong number, it will display a stranger's name. Check whether your bank does this too. It will minimize user error. 

If you are sending money to a friend for the 1st time, split it into 2 transactions. Send a small amount first and check whether your friend properly receive it. Zelle is free so multiple transactions won't cost you. 

IMO, Zelle is better than Venmo. With Venmo, I need to create another ID and link my bank account, which adds security risk. If my Venmo gets hacked, it can drain my bank balance instantly. OTOH, I'm using my existing bank to do Zelle. If my bank gets hacked, I'm toast regardless of Zelle/Venmo.

So I'm renting a unit right now at $700 a month. I like it, great location, good area, great place to be. During this last year, the landlord passed away and the lease was transferred to a new company in town which continued the current lease stipulations. 

My question is regarding what options for next year are. The lease is up in August. I'd love to stay here, but am curious what that might look like - are they compelled to go into a month-to-month, or can they write up a new agreement? They've emailed with a new lease this past week with a $50 rent increase - this seems strange to me during current times as I don't believe property values are increasing, and their costs seem to be much less. Can I argue/negotiate that, or would that be shooting myself in the foot?

I'm also considering buying if they'd be interested in selling. Would that be a beneficial move on their part? Again, they inherited the property due to previous landlord's death and previous management company's closing. Would it be better, on their end, to just continue raking in the easy money they didn't invest anything into building, or would they rather have a sale and the property off their hands? I'd like to gauge interest, but never know how to play that from a good place and not hand them information they can use against me.

Finally, the previous company simply disappeared after the landlord's death, and has run off with all security deposits, it would seem. Current (new) company has communicated this, but as a ""sorry if we can't get it back, looks like you're out $700"" which I find completely ridiculous, and am well prepared to fight.

My wife and I were traveling home to another state with our personal vehicle, a 98 Honda Accord. It had 120000 miles on it, so I knew it had life in it. We had just purchased it for $2400 secondhand a month before. I took the car to get the oil changed at a place, I'll call Spiffy Lube. They replaced my radiator cap after saying it needed it, cool. We get four hours down the road and an hour from the nearest town, and the car blows the engine. Smoke, burning oil, flashing dashboard, the whole shebang.


So we get towed and the mechanic says it'll be $3250 to replace the engine, distributor cap, and all hoses because we had a bulge in our coolant lines, it burst, and that's why the engine overheated and blew. Note that very morning Spiffy Lube replaced my radiator cap. Why didn't they check my hoses while they were at it?


Now we have to decide. Do we just scrap the car, after we had very little money and try to get an auto loan? (At the time I had sub 550 credit). Or do we max out our credit to repair the car?

For background, started a job out of school in downtown houston that pays 65K-70K gross + bonus of \~20K per year (Semi-guaranteed, but who knows in this environment, and it is taxed differently I believe).

Given the long work hours and Houston traffic I'd like to live as close to work as possible, and because of traffic and parking garages, Even a 1 mile car commute takes like 20 min. Additionally, monthly parking is $200 and not reimbursed by the company. I know its not frugal, but I'm thinking of moving to a downtown apartment which is around $1500-1700/mo not counting $100 of fees/utilities on top. Basically, any 1 bedroom apartment here, outside downtown but still a reasonable commute, is at a minimum $1300 on the low end for a seedier place, probably $1400-$1500 on average. So the parking basically cancels out the slightly higher downtown rent, plus less gas and car depreciation, and adds a minimum of 15-20 minutes to the commute due to traffic vs. a 5 min. walk to work.

Is the $\~1600/month rent doable for me? I know it sounds like a lot especially for a low COL area but the parking situation makes it a more difficult decision. Basically the alternative is to get roommates outside of Downtown and I could pay less than $1000, but I'd have to have roommates and 30+ min commute while working 60-70 hours a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Financially numbers are important-

Liquid Assets-

\-30k high risk tech mutual fund with 8 years of growth. Initially my retirement when I had no 401k

\-20k in assorted corona stock investment (Willing to dump today)

\-39k checking account

Total 89k able to use today for a down payment

&amp;#x200B;

Funds I don't want to leverage, but could if it's recommended-

\-7k in long term stocks I don’t want to sell low.

\-115.5k in my 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

Earnings / Expenses-

Rent for the next 3.5 months paid up front.

$1,200 after taxes minimal weekly check earnings. 16,800 minimum over next 3.5 months.

\~1k monthly credit card expenses (food, entertainment, etc) so 3.5 k over the next 3.5 months

Total 13.5k more to spend on a down payment in the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing the numbers, I could afford $3k total a month for a condo. That would be HOA/Property Taxes/Mortgage. The plan would be to sell and get a house in 10 years to have a family and raise kids. Is it worth it to dump all my security blanket money, and investments, to buy a condo to start earning equity. Or is it better to keep renting, avoiding property taxes and interest rates, allowing me to invest more in the market with possibly higher returns? Thus building up more money for a larger down payment later, and letting me spend less money in my life overall on interest. If anyone knows, and I don't think anyone really does, where is the housing market heading for the greater nyc area, as employees and companies are moving out of the city?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Use all my money to buy property with today's low interest rates, and uncertain market, around NYC. Or keep dumping money in the stock market.","Buy property, or rent and invest in the stock market? 31 in Manhattan."

I am sort of familiar with the pro-rata rule which I was trying to avoid for tax paperwork sake so I made my deposit into my traditional IRA in the beginning of the month and promptly converted to Roth when funds cleared, well I guess even at the end of the month since there was a day or so I had money in my core position within that month I got some interest so I have a penny. Should I try and deal with this and how if so? Is the a non interest baring core position like true cash?

personalfinance,"Hi all, my spouse was recently notified that he’s getting 100% disability through the VA. This provides an extra $3300 a month, tax free for life and will never be reduced. We live in Texas, which has a full exemption on property tax for 100% disabled vets.

With this news, I’m wondering how quickly we can get into a home with a VA home loan. Initially I was planning to have us fully pay off our car notes before we look at home ownership but that may be unnecessary? 

Current financial situation:

-	Income (after tax) - 8100/mo
    -	4800/mo (me), 3300/mo (him)

-	Savings - 8000
    -	saving 1000/mo
    

-	Credit card debt - 8700
    -	paying 1000/mo with final balloon payment from savings for payoff in October
    

-	Car payment 1 - 520/mo at 2.74% 
    -	28,500 remaining
    

-	Car payment 2 - 448/mo at 1% 
    -	16,900 remaining

Currently he has student loan debt but this is not included as this can be discharged due to his service disability.

By the time we get to February 2022, when I think we should be ready to buy, we’d have about $25000 in car debt remaining. No other debt and approximately $72000 in savings.

Would this be a total pipe dream or do you think we’d be approved for a home loan?

We could feasibly have already paid the cars off but we’re both going crazy in this small apartment and we’re wanting to have kids in the near future.","Income circumstances changing soon, looking for advice on balancing savings vs debt payments"

personalfinance,"We have a 2012 Subaru that is in decent condition. With about 95K miles on it, we own the vehicle and pay standard insurance with collision coverage. 

My SO is the owner of the vehicle, and basically just drives it to and from work (which is about 5 miles round trip). 

We just put $1500 into last month, for general maintenance and brakes. However, the AC unit has stopped working and they've identified cracks in the piping and Freon leaking in 3 places. Needs to be replace, which is around another $1400. 

The dealership has a program that would pay us the already paid $1500, plus the trade-in value of the vehicle if we purchase a new one with them. 

My question is, should we put another money dump into this thing, which would bring it to about $3,000 in just about 2 months. Or, should we trade it in and suck up the cost of a new car. 

We would look for a veicle around $20,000, with the trade in and some cash down we would have to finance about half of it, but interest rates are low.

I'm thinking we should just fix it, and suck the $1400 up. Hopefully, that's the end of the repairs for this thing for a hot minute. We have the cash to fix it, so I'm thinking we just do that.

personalfinance,"Back when i was young and dumb, I let a friend convince me that I should sign up for a universal life insurance policy. Now, it’s only for 100,000 because again I was (am still) single, low debt, and low risk. I’ve been paying $50 a month for my policy for the past 9-10 years. The policy premium is about 25-30 and the rest is put in a non market fund.

He said the cost to fix the backlights would be $500, but because the company cared very much about its customers during this challenging time, they will take $250 off.

I will admit I was very excited and ready to pay.

Now came the scam. He said I could only get these deals IF I PAID TODAY. I would have paid today, if it wasn't for how he wanted payment. He wanted me to go to Walmart/7Eleven/CVS to check a payment  and send them the code. Only then will the technician come and fix it.

2. The fund choices in 401k generally SUCK.  I was always in a mix of S&amp;P500 index or bonds.
3. Buffett and Dalio are bearish. Buffett is waiting to buy stocks.  I'm considering doing the same and buying if/when the market crashes.
4. Feel more confident at my age to buy stocks and take long positions. Intelligent Investor style.
5. If/when the crash happens, I think the gains to be made with so many stocks on sale could make up for the tax penalties

Her incentive to use the housing allowance is of course to lower her tax bracket for Fed/State.

So a few questions:

(1) Let's say her parents normally spend monthly $2000 on the mortgage and $1000 on property tax, HOA, home insurance, utilities, etc. Can she ""pitch-in"" $1000 from her housing allowance specifically targeting the non-mortgage payments without forfeiting her parents' ability to continue deducting mortgage interest while also allowing her to use the $1000 monthly housing allowance as a legitimate housing expense?

(2) Being that she and her parents are family, will her contribution to the monthly housing expenses count as income for her parents, or does it not matter since they are essentially a multi-generational family living under one roof?

(3) Are there any other tax implications that need to be addressed in this scenario?

personalfinance,"Hi everyone, I hope this isn't too complicated. I was pre med in college, but also had undiagnosed complex ptsd due to my childhood it greatly impacts my ability to focus, concentrate and function right now. My parents wouldn't let me take time off bc my lack concentration and focus were producing grades that didn't reflect my abilities (they thought that would lead me to drop out, go wild, etc.) unfortunately that just left me struggling and with grades so bad I was dropped from the school. I was diagnosed properly a few years later, about 5 years ago. 

So, I had been left disowned on my own using credit cards, (I was dumb and figured oh I'm going to be a doctor ill be fine) my credit score is in the 600s, I don't have a degree and am finding only minimum wage jobs. I'm struggling bc I'm in therapy and that is expensive, but something I need to help me heal so I can focus and go back to school.

I have a fed loan of about 15k, about 3k in credit card debt. Is it worth going back to school to get a 4 year degree? I've taken enough classes to have an associates in art and an associates in science if I take one more class... But I feel like that doesn't hold up for anything. Returning back to a 4 year school would mean me digging myself out of a hole due to my grades from the university. Majoring in science scares me bc there's no guarantee I make it into a masters program to become a physician's assistant and don't want to be left without a job and student loans. I also have had to dip into my savings to go to therapy with covid so I barely have a couple grand if that.

I've been thinking about going and getting a degree I can just get a job out of college in case getting my masters doesn't work out (which I have no idea in what) ...but my bf suggests a degree wouldn't do much except weigh me with debt and I should do a medical trade program instead, but I feel like that would limit me.

personalfinance,"Edit/update:  Vanguard also holds her HSA account funds.  Vanguard was historically adding HSA account balance to the 401k balance when viewing the dashboard balance, so that number we used to see was 401k + HSA. Vanguard said they stopped showing that sum in their dashboard at some point and now only shows the 401k balance in the dashboard.  We checked the HSA balance and sure enough, it is the discrepancy we are now seeing, so mystery solved.  /edit

Here's a doozie--my wife and keep a spreadsheet of our financial account balances on about a monthly basis, sometimes on a biweekly basis.  This is essentially just us logging into our accounts and reading the balances off the site's dashboard for our account and writing that value into the spreadsheet.

This morning, my wife was doing hers and noticed that her vanguard account balance was significantly less this morning than it was ~14 days ago.  She checked her account history statements in Vanguard and none of the values they show for her account in the statements going back to January match what she had recorded through the dashboard.  Basically January and on in her statements show about a -$30k discrepancy with vanguard vs. what she actually recorded in the tracking spreadsheet we keep.

This is a mock up of what our spreadsheet looks like vs. what we are now seeing in the Vanguard account as of this morning:

Month | Spreadsheet | Vanguard's
-----|-----------|----------
Dec | 200k | 200k
Jan | 205k | 175k
Feb | 200k | 170k
Mar | 180k | 150k
Apr | 185k | 155k

It is not the market drop due to the pandemic because the discrepancy starts in January, before the global markets that the investments we held responded to anything, and it doesn't explain the ongoing discrepancy between their statements vs. what we recorded from the account dashboard and wrote into our tracking spreadsheet.

We don't download the quarterly statements as a matter of habit and we have paperless communication enabled, so basically what Vanguard has now is the only official information we have on our accounts, and it comes down to a ""we said, they said"" thing.

I can understand a transcription error once, but I can't believe that we were recording it wrong 3-4 months in a row.

We looked at the historical trend view that Vanguard shows, and they are reflecting the -$30k discrepancy in their chart all the way back to January 2020 in the historical trend, December 2019 matches.

My employer also uses Vanguard so I tried logging into my account to see if something weird is also going on, and I am getting an error when trying to view any of my account information.  Which is also a bit troubling.

BACK STORY:

As a 20 years old I started to learn about personal finance and I was at the time in the warehouse doing overtime which paid good money and I saved most of it. Till last year I just got laid off from my work and I had all this money and I was depressed about my dad passing away and just friends talking bad behind me and the girl who I thought I would spend the rest of my life had another guy at the same time.  I know these don't sound that crazy problems but to me they were at the moment bigger than life. Last year summer I started spending my savings which I had around 30000 euros at the end of Christmas I had spent all of it and I took a loan 20000 euros before Christmas.  First I explained to myself that I was going to use the 20000 for something investments or courses or school. It all went down to drinking and traveling alone. Spending was for me that I use this money before I would commit suicide. I was going through therapy at the moment and it just didn't help or I just didn't put enough work to it. This year January I had zero in savings and I own to the bank the 20000 euros. Doctors and friends wanted me to go to the psych ward because I was suicidal but I didn't have the money to go. Of course they will make you like a payment program that is like 50 euros a month type but I just didn't have money and I was living with moms and I am still living with my mom.  

Now it is the corona so its very hard to get a job and I am trying still to get one close to full hours but there are lots of people also trying to get a job. Competition is hard. One thing doesn't help because when I was depressed and I got an interview I didn't go so there are many marks in my name in these temp companies that hire for company that I didn't go to the interview and I deserve it. I tried to get job but depression and being lazy costed me so that is one reason why its very hard to get an interview even at this moment.

My personal example is something I'm about to pull the trigger on. In short, I've been out of college for about 5 years, went to a cheap state school (aka, I have no debt whatsoever) and I've managed to amass a hefty savings. I have no debt. No car payment.

I could buy a bizillion scooters in cash, yes.

personalfinance,"I am currently looking for a new lease for next May and with some suppliers having 9m+ delivery times here in Germany, now is the time.

Many people here have the opinion that leasing is usually the absolute worst. I had a used car before I leased and it was many times more expensive due to higher gas usage and mainly repair costs.

Well, thanks to the German Government, I got 15k for scrapping that car on my lease contract and now lease a VW Arteon for 130€ (+131€ insurance) per month.

Of course, that was an exception. But there are almost always some benefits to take advantage of, right now it's the E-Motor Bonus (6k).

I personally absolutely recommend leasing as you can plan your finances with less risk, and if you are smart, it's also the cheapest option if you are looking for a (relatively) new car. 
Important:
1) You can't be picky about the brand or model. There are often incredible deals - but only on a specific model. You can't choose, but it's a new car and won't get any cheaper. 

2) Use any state-sponsored Bonus available. 
3) Look up deals on the Internet and have your local dealer match them. 

If you lease without any deals directly from the producer then it's of course expensive. But if you are smart and flexible, leasing is one of the greatest and riskless ways of driving a car.",Why is Leasing so bad?

Someone I know used to work for Company X, and they began their pension plan and/or 401k there with Company X. It was acquired years earlier by Company Y, so now it's known as that: Company Y. 

So there have been rumors of Company Y declaring bankruptcy, and this person is concerned and would like to know whether their existing pension plan/401k are at risk. To elaborate, this person began those two things under Company X which was then merged into Company Y.

So the primary, two most important questions I'd like to know from this are: 

1) If Company Y declares bankruptcy and liquidates, **what happens** to the pension plans and 401k? Aka, the ones from Company X before the merger? This is a complicated question because there have been some rumors that the pension plans and 401k are ""with the government"" and not Company Y? This may also not be the case at all, I'm not sure. I'd just like clarity if they're at risk of being lost. Are there laws protecting employees from such things?

2) In addition, my second main question is: if the answer to #1 is that they are at risk (or even if they're not, for future reference), is there some specific type of ""private"" pension plan that is safe even from company bankruptcy and liquidation? 

All this comes from an uncertainty of whether to continue on with work and risk losing the pension plan/401k should the company bankrupt, or jump ship.

Last week, my employer emailed the employees informing them that they had paid out everyone's accrued PTO ""to help them out"" with finances. This obviously upset a lot of people since we were not consulted about this decision and it affects our unemployment for the week. My coworker contacted the company and was told that the PTO had to be paid out for legal reasons as the employees had been furloughed for an extended period of time. I have looked online for this law, but I cannot find anything concrete stating that they were required to do this. I would like to contact them tomorrow requesting them to take back my pay out so that they can spread it out over a couple of weeks (if they must pay it out) so it does not affect my unemployment. Most of all, though, I am frustrated that they did not give us a choice and they initially told employees that their PTO was cashed as goodwill and not because of a legal requirement.

personalfinance,"Hello all!

I am a rising sophomore in college and was thinking about purchasing a car. I love cars and it is my main hobby along with learning about finance. I know that buying a car is probably a stupid decision and will not make me any money, but I want to know how badly this would affect me. For context, I am really into the idea of FIRE, but I also want to enjoy life. I think that working myself to the bone and living off of scraps to retire would be a waste of my life, especially when I am young, but I want to find that balance, but will this purchase ruin my future?

Thanks to r/wallstreetbets (I know they go completely against everything this sub preaches) I have made 18k over the past few months and saved it in my car fund. I live at home and commute to college so a car is necessary, but the commute is fairly short so mpg is not the key factor in this decision. I also am employed by my college and make around $800 a month which also includes parking (Huge plus). Considering my family supports me and has agreed to pay for insurance throughout college, this income goes straight into my savings. As for student loan debt, I max out my federal loans and pay the rest off immediately. The deferred interest while in college tied with the 4.5% interest rate made that a no-brainer.

What I want to know is will spending around 15k for a car I expect to own for \~8+ years a bad decision. The car I am looking at is a Lexus GS 350. This seems like a car that would be suitable to keep and be satisfied years from now, but also has the reliability to last those years. Currently, I own and maintain a 2000 Mazda Miata, which is cheap and fun, but very impractical. 

As for car-related expenses such as maintenance and repairs, I plan on doing all of them myself. The Miata provided me an opportunity to learn how to repair just about everything that could break on a car. While this is no guarantee I will be able to fix any and all problems, a blown head gasket would not be a life stopping issue.

personalfinance,"I keep seeing people posting thread after thread asking how they can increase their credit scores. Usually asking if it's possible for them to set a bunch of money on fire to in order to bump their credit score up. You all need to understand that most of what you learned in life about credit is complete and total bullshit. The conventional financial wisdom in the US is flat out garbage. In all probability, most of you, like me, were surrounded by people who were bad with money, and that reflects itself in how you view money and credit. You have to completely throw that mentality out the window and start from ground zero if you want to be financially successful in a place where nobody else is. 

For true, long term success, the number you want to be high is your net worth. Don't look at your monthly income and wonder how much of a car payment you can fit there. Look at your annual income and expenses, and your projected future income with investments. Your credit score is only useful insofar as it allows you to increase your net worth by giving you a better interest rate on a mortgage. If you take care of your money right, later in life, your credit score could be 0 and it wouldn't affect you one bit, so it's really not that important. If you aren't in the market for a house, you're better off forgetting about the thing rather than obsessing over it.

Apparently, during this same time, I was also living 15 miles North of college, renting a luxury home for $4,000 a month and skipped out on rent. My credit report held a collection somewhere in the $10K range for a long time. 

I have spent years disputing this and it coming back with the whole “after investigation, this information has been shown to be accurate and no changes will be made to your record” or whatever the phrasing.

It didn’t matter what I did. I would get in contact with the leasing company and state my case and they would just say, “ we cannot give you that information. When the dispute reaches us, we will be able to give them the information we have on file.”

So, honestly? After a number of years. I just started ignoring it. My mindset was just “whatever, I’m fucked, everything’s fucked. Whatever.”

Eventually it start dropping off it my credit reports. Yay. Today it doesn’t show up on any of my 3 reports. Cool. We can move on, right?

1. Giving us all/some of the money no strings attached
2. Loaning the money which we could pay back $500 a month over the course of 5 years (it's likely that we could pay it off sooner)
3. Pulling the money from a trust for me in lieu of giving me the money when they pass away.

I apologize for any formatting or grammatical errors that may follow as I am currently very stressed. 

Recently I admitted myself into detox to kick an addiction to alcohol. 
When I was working with the rehab center on how much I would owe, I was told my insurance company would pay 70% of the cost and I would owe 30%. I was quoted for a 7 day stay in detox.

That 30% was $2415.00 of which I had to pay ~1200 as a deductible prior to admission. I financed out the rest over a period of 18 months.

I spent 4 days total in detox and was given a clean bill of health to leave. 

Recently I was mailed a letter by my health insurance stating they had denied a claim for $14,800. The letter stated I maybe responsible to pay for the amount billed.

When I looked up what I was being billed for, it stated ""Room and Board""

Key points:
-Told my insurance would cover 70% of detox program regardless of being out-of-network.
-Told I would be responsible for $2415.00
-Insurance denied claim made by rehab center in the amount of $14,800 for room and board.
-Was told I would be pro rated for my shortened stay.

Im not sure what my options ars here, or if im just stuck with owing my insurance company almost 15k.
Any advice would be appreciated.
Thank you!","How to handle $15,000 in medical bills?"
personalfinance,"Ive been using the app GetUpside and it has provided me with almost $25 in cash back savings! 

You can extract your savings as a gift card (various options available; amazon, apple app store, google play, Walmart, target, Starbucks, various restaurants), pay pal, or mailed check.

The only thing you need to do is select a gas station on the map provided in app. I have been amazed how often I find a gas station. And before you pump you ‘check in’ on the app. This will activate your gas purchase with the card you use at the pump and you have listed on the app. 

Takes a few days to process but I get back on a $23 purchase of gas $1-3 returned. This depends which gas station you select. Ive seen some cash back on every gallon as low as 2 cents and some as high as 15 cents. I normally pump into my sedan 12-14 gallons. Why not save on the commodity I use almost every day.

personalfinance,"Good evening everyone. Is this a good time to look into buying a house or should I wait until I marry my fiancee? I am getting tired of renting my apartment, and dealing with either annoying tenants or cheap landlords (among other things). I have always wanted to buy a house in North Jersey (some of my favorite choices are Kearny, North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford, East Rutherford, and Carlstadt) that has at least three bedrooms (with a master's bedroom having its own bathroom), at least two full sized bathrooms, two car garages, a decent driveway, a nice size backyard, basement, and attic. 

I make about $36096.22 a year after taxes and other deductions ($51491.84 before taxes and other deductions). I am part of the CWA Union in my state government job (I am unsure if that would help me get a better morgage rate for a house). However, I do not think that I make enough to afford to buy a house. I pay $1300 a month for rent (a 1 bedroom apt. with parking, heat; and hot water included), and about $43 in total for PSE&amp;G at the moment.

personalfinance,"Hi all, first off I want to thank everyone in advance for the help. Let me start by saying a year ago I was in a rather bad accident that ended up with months of physical therapy and multiple surgeries. Thanks to my underinsured motorist policy I am getting $250k before lawyer fees and medical settlement. I will likely be ending the day with ~$140k. 

My current financial situation is pretty good as I make 188k a year between my wife and I but I made a lot of dumb mistakes up to about a year ago. This entailed using a high interest credit card and racking up ~24k in CC debt on a 28% rewards card. I’ve smartened up and have transferred all of it to 0% cards and am making the necessary payments to ensure all debt is done by the end of the 0% terms, which is about another year. Our mortgage is ~2000k a month and our balance is 390K. We have two car loans at 2.6% each and a total balance of 70k between the two. My wife also has 15k in student loan debt.

My plan was to pay off the student loans and the cars which would more than half. After that, I’m not sure what to do with the rest. Does it make sense to do that or should I be looking to do something else with the entire amount?

I noticed my score actually took a hit and dropped 19 points, which seems to be common when people pay off a lot of credit ?

Hello, 

My Girlfriend of 5 years and I have come to a very difficult situation in regards to financial imbalance.

When it comes to talking about getting a home, retiring, having kids, and short/long term investments that she would like me to meet half of the costs.  For example; she would like me to be able to put money towards a down payment on a home as well as into my retirement. Which I would love to but I am still in debt and haven’t been able to crawl out of for a long time.

My girlfriend comes from a very comfortable lifestyle, she grew up in a middle class home and didn’t want for anything financially.  Her parents paid for her college, she lived at home until she was 23 and saved money from a seasonal job her father gave her.(Working on a fishing boat for 3 months out of the year)  Her Dad still pays for her phone. Her Grandmother has given her 13k a year for the duration of our relationship. She gets money for her birthday and such regularly.  When she wanted to buy a condo her Grandmother gave her 20k for a down payment. When she was buying a new car her dad gave her 5k for it.  She is very frugal and very intelligent with money. She invests in stocks regularly and makes money from that. Her stocks alone went up 10k last year. She also just got 100k from her Grandma this year which she will invest.

I came from a very different background.  I grew up in poverty in a cult in Utah. I was home-schooled my whole life and moved out when I was 16.  I have been working since I was 9, (I supported my family financially from 9-13) however I have been in debt since I was 18 due to emergency dental work without insurance. A tax debacle when I was 19 due to being a general contractor and not knowing exactly what that was. And also attempting to go to a social justice college that didn’t work out. I do not have a healthy relationship with money and she has helped me with that very much over our 5 year relationship. She has loaned me money to get a better living situation, which I paid back in full within 7 months.   She has let me live rent free in her condo with her for the last two years when my bar closed overnight and I lost my job.  We still split the food costs, and she usually has a roommate that covers most of her mortgage. I pay for my own phone and personal bills. And hopefully in the future will pay her back rent for the time I’ve been living  here.

Early on in our relationship when we would go food shopping or go to restaurants we would split stuff down to the penny. She was very adamant about it and it had always been slightly off putting.  She has definitely gotten better at that but I think it shows her relationship with money.

I am a big gift giver so I spend a lot of money and time finding her stuff she likes. I have dialed back on this of course since losing my job. Last year we talked about a 5 year financial plan and what we were working towards very shortly after my bar closed overnight. I then decided to take a year off trying to focus on my mental/emotional health. I had a lot of stuff I hadn’t been able to deal with since I have just been surviving in life. I got diagnosed with Aspergers and PTSD this last year and she has been an amazing support throughout the whole process. She was a part of this decision and agreed it was the most logical time for me to spend the time on this (I still of course paid for my own food/bills throughout this just not rent to her) and couldn’t spend money towards our 5 year plan. She is resentful about this and I am unsure on how to deal with that emotion.  

We are talking about investing more into our future together about having kids, travel, house etc and I just don’t feel like I can match her financially at least for another 10 years. She worked hard for 8 years fishing (3 months a year) and has invested in her future, and her retirement and I am very happy for her. However I don’t think I will be able to match her income and she is still requiring a 50/50 breakdown. If you’re investing in a future with someone, it stops becoming an you/I thing and starts becoming an US and OUR future together. ESPECIALLY if there is talk of kids.  I think moving forward our finances need to be split based on our incomes which includes money from her family and inheritance.  I DO NOT WANT HER MONEY for my self.  I just want equal effort towards our future.   She is able to work 20 hours a week because of where she comes from and I do not think it is fair if we are working on a future together for me to work twice as much to put in an equal 50/50 amount.  Any advice on a compromise or a way to communicate this better would be amazing.",Partner (31f) and I (28M) can’t agree on our financial goals going forward. And have an income imbalance.

personalfinance,"Today my spouse and I submitted a joint application to Bank of America for an auto loan in the amount of $10,000. We were denied and sent an Adverse Action Letter citing my Experian credit report.

**Background:**

* We have held checking/savings accounts with BofA for 11 years, and have had a joint credit card at BofA for 6 years. We use the card for all of our expenses and pay it off weekly. 
* My debts: approximately $90,000 across multiple federal student loans (2015-2020). I just graduated, start work soon, and my income will be $90,000. My current FICO is 770 and my credit score (listed in the Experian Adverse Action Letter) is 741.
* My spouse's debts: $10,000 in federal student loans (2015) and a $10,000 auto loan (Wells Fargo, 2017). Spouse's income is $60,000. His credit history is approximately 3 years older than mine.  He qualified for his 2017 auto loan without issue, and with a $35,000 income. His current FICO is 795.

The Adverse Action Letter singled me out specifically for 3 reasons: ""insufficient credit history, insufficient income, requested loan amount too high."" We pulled our credit reports and there is no adverse history at all. On my Experian report, it looks like the CARES Act student loan waiver may have been incorrectly reported by my student loan servicer, which may be the issue here. (All my student loans are listed as ""exceptional payment history, paid: closed"" on my Experian report, but are listed as open and active on my TransUnion report.) I am investigating this and have contacted Experian, who assured me that my student accounts are open and active from their perspective, and will be contacting my loan servicer.

We are putting $10,000 down and financing up to $10,000 on a CPO. We will be applying to other lenders (local credit union, Capital One, Ally \[where we keep most of our savings\]) with hopefully better results. 

If the ""closed"" student loan accounts aren't the issue, why would we have been denied? Is it my debt to income ratio? Is it my credit utilization, since I haven't begun paying my student loans yet? I don't think 6+ years is too short of a credit history, we don't have poor credit scores, we don't have any adverse remarks on our credit reports, and our household income is more than sufficient for the requested loan amount.",Why was I denied an auto loan?

We plan to live in San Antonio forever.

Fortunately  my reserve job needed me full time which I will be doing for a while locally x1 year (~$6-8k before taxes) 

My concern is my income is not  the same every month. I am hopeful that in one year therapy will pick up again at hospitals (elective surgeries, etc.).
 
Should we buy a house now? And if so how much can we afford.

My thoughts are: we aren’t getting any younger, we plan to live here forever, and we are paying rent. Concerns instability in economy and my jobs, but both seem to balance out depending on the economic situation.

A $170K home would be no different than our monthly rent, a $220k home wouldn’t feel different either as my spouse use to pay $300 month for healthcare is not longer doing that..

I'm sitting on about $4,000 I can spend on any one of these loans. I want to make an informed decision on which one I should pay or pay off (federal student loan). Do I pay off the student loan entirely or tackle the private or car loan? Any advice would be appreciated.

I have more than sufficient funds in my checking account, and the dealership is holding the car I've chosen. The kicker: I don't have any checks! My bank does not operate in the state I'm moving to, and my flight leaves before the banks open here, so I cannot get a cashier's check. All the stores around me are closed overnight due to COVID, so I can't purchase the supplies to print my own checks. The car is around $15k, so I can't put it on a debit or credit card.

My current plan is to just risk going to the dealership with no check and hoping I can wire the money to them or something along those lines. It is possible that they'll offer better financing than the loan I currently possess, in which case I would just have to pay the downpayment with my credit or debit card.

personalfinance,"So I was living in Spain for 6 months (was supposed to be a year), and opened a bank account with Sabadell there (only a debit card). That was already a huge hassle, but from the minute I signed up it's easily the worst system ever. Both the username and password have to be long numbers, the app sucks, you can only do stuff besides deposits and withdrawals at the branch you opened your account at, and to log in you have to get a verification code each and every time, etc, etc.. There's also a $30 recurring fee for ""non-residents"".

Anyways flash forward to when Covid hit, I had to leave Spain on extremely short notice, and had a very rough couple months that I won't go into detail about. About a month ago when things settled down for me, I finally had the mental capacity to go start the procedure of closing my account with them. Except I have not been able to log since I left Spain. The verification texts aren't working, I couldn't call them because they only have a Spanish number, their email support literally just didn't write back to me at all, and then I finally decided to try their twitter. I'm actually getting responses on that as of a few days ago, but they've been unable to help me even log in so far since the texts aren't working. Also because of time differences they don't respond to messages until like 1am my time

I'm not really sure what to do now, except hope that when I talk to them again tonight they can send the code somewhere else. My account was fairly close to $0 when I left but I'm imagining that with the recurring ($30 every 3 months) fee and overdraft charges I'm going to be looking at a massive negative balance. I didn't have any monthly subscriptions or anything luckily.

Icing on the cake, I've just received an email in Spanish about something about sending the account to collections and saying I need to pay.

Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated. Do you think that once I finally get back into my account they'll refund me, since it should be just fees and overdraft fees caused by the fees?

personalfinance,"A few days ago, I made a post inquiring about homebuying. This post pertains to a new specialized topic - *physician loans*.

My wife is a medical resident and as such we (she) will qualify for the physician loan program. In a nutshell, here's what that means:

* No downpayment at all required

* No PMI for downpayments under 20%

* Currently, about a 3.25-3.5% interest rate

So my question here is somewhat a theoretical question - because there's no PMI, what's the downside to putting almost no money down so long as we're not jacking up our presumed purchase price? For instance, we're looking at a $300k house (we make a combined 150k - I make 100, she makes 50). This is a reasonable purchase price for our income. We *can* put $30k down for a 10% downpayment, but why would we if there's no PMI? Following the conventional wisdom that the money can (in theory) get more returns in even a low-return bond fund (4% returns instead of 3.25% interest avoidance), doesn't it make sense to keep all of the money that would otherwise go to a downpayment and stick it in investments? 

The other factor i'm considering is cash-on-hand. Now more than ever (I sound like a generic commercial), I feel like having cash available is a luxury for a few reasons:

*  if the market tanks again I can get in at a favorable position

* if I get laid off, that $30k now represents about 8 additional months of emergency fund or about a year's worth of mortgage payments

Hello all, pleasantries all around! At the ripe old age of 28, I kid, as to some I’m a kid (we really need sarcasm text), I have begun my understanding and learning of proper personal finance. I’m hitting the books and will continue to learn more as I try to make larger dents in my debt… I’d also say I’m quite lucky that my neighbor has studied accounting and is guiding me in the right direction regarding planning and methods to pay off my debt. As of currently, I am utilizing the snowball method.

Per her advice on trying to get as much financial information from people and books, I’m running this over with like minded, financially focused people, plus you all are much cheaper than therapy. In all seriousness, just looking for more advice as I continue this financial journey.

Scholarships vary as FIU guarantees $3K - $15K, employer contributes $1800 per fiscal year xD

* Cost - I have savings to help carry me through part of school, but I'd still have to borrow; I graduate undergrad with no debt so i was able to build cash savings and retirement

personalfinance,"Hello all,

I've seen lots of posts and articles stating that we should look to save roughly 15%-20% of our paychecks. I have a lot of questions regarding this range and would love some insight if possible.

* Does the 15%-20% mean that you are saving this money and just putting it into a savings account or does it also include money that you contribute to a 401k and a Roth IRA?
* If it does include both 401K and Roth IRA, does the following situation get me to 15%-20%?
   * I make roughly 3k a month; I put $500/month into a Roth IRA which is about 16.67% of my take-home pay and I contribute 5% (pre-tax) to my employers 403b. This puts me at 21.67%, right?
   * Everything else I don't spend for that month goes into my savings account (which I hope to contribute to a taxable brokerage account via low-cost index funds soon). Does this mean that any extra money I save or invest in the taxable brokerage account will increase the initial 21.67%?
* In regards to my employer 403b, for every 1% I contribute, my employer contributes 2%, up to 5%. So since I contribute 5%, my employer contributes an additional 10%. Is it common for individuals to consider the employer contribution as part of the 15%-20% goal?

personalfinance,"I have two credit cards - one with a balance of $917 and the other, a balance of $6000. I get paid twice monthly, so my current mode of operation has been: leftover from 1st of the month goes into savings (~$200), half of the leftover from the 15th of the month goes into savings and the other half gets split in two and pays down the cards. I now have $2k in a separate savings account, which is enough to cover one month’s expenses and then some.

Using my current budget (which does not account for bonuses or an upcoming pay raise), I’m due to pay off the $917 credit card by August, even with an added ~$40 a month in interest rates. However, looking at my main bank account right now, I realized that what I have in *that* savings + $10 transferred from checking would be enough to pay my credit card in full. Then, starting next month, I could throw all my leftover money from the 15th paycheck at the second credit card (nearly $700 a month), have that paid off by the end of the year or sooner, and still be putting $200+ a month into savings.","Pay off credit card debt in chunks, or all at once?"

personalfinance," Here are my initial thoughts on what I should do with the money: Keep it in the highest-yield savings account I can, pretend it doesn't exist, keep working/earning, and use my savings to move to a more affordable city when my lease ends in September 2021.

I currently live in a somewhat expensive area and the bedroom I'm renting costs me $800 per month. I rarely get to use the kitchen, the living room is basically off limits, and I've been sharing this space with someone I don't really jive with since 2016. The idea of living on my own is...incredible to think about. I'd be willing to pay a little more for some breathing room. I don't really have many close friends irl, so moving wouldn't completely destroy my social life either.

I'm pretty sure I can bribe some pals with food and cash to help me with a rental truck as well as the drive (I don't have my license and don't plan to get one), so hopefully the move itself won't be more than $2K max. The apartments I've looked at in my desired area are all between $750 and $850 rent-wise, which is fantastic, and if I'm smart with my current savings, I should have enough to get me by for a good chunk of time if I end up struggling to find work.

I'm sure that my monthly expenses overall will go up since I'll be paying for my own utilities and internet, and it'll be a slightly different climate, but I think it'll be worth it if I can find my footing there. I'm still trying to figure out what to do career-wise, but I worked remotely even before the whole quarantine situation, so I'm sure I can figure something out.

I’m about 30 days away from my new construction home being completed. To secure a loan, I decided to go with a family friend. He’s spent a few hours putting together all the documents needed and helping me through the process. He came back today and said we can do a 30 day lock for 3.5% or hold off and gamble our odds at a 3.3% rate for a 15 day lock. However, there are a handful of very reputable local credit unions that are offering 2.875% for the same terms (30yr fixed, no points, 5% down). I’ve brought up the credit unions to him in the past but he dismissed them saying more than likely they’d require 20% down and he would be able to get the lowest rate. 
I know once you sign up with a realtor, you almost always have to use them once you’re pretty far into the process. Is it the same with a mortgage broker? I’ll bring it up to him tomorrow, but if for some reason he dismisses the credit union, can I dump him and go through the credit union instead without any large fees?
Also, I’ve already paid for the appraisal ($470). Can that appraisal work for the credit union, or would that need to be paid again?
The difference between a 3.5% rate and 2.875% would be $110 a month to me so it’s definitely a big difference.

I have only had access to my own salary (\~$56k or $1,560 take home every two weeks) since November and my job is stable.

I own an older Toyota that is in reasonable shape.

I could never save money when my wife had access to our joint income.  She makes twice what I make and she has had to ask for temporary loans from me until payday on several occasions.

**My Questions:**

I would like to approach the three banks that charged off the credit cards and try to get them to take 50% as a settlement.  Since I don't see any debt collectors on my credit report, does that mean the charged off debts are still with the CC companies and I could communicate with them directly?  I really hope to avoid debt collectors, but I don't know if that's a reasonable expectation.  Is 50% even a possibility?  

I know my credit is FUBARed, probably for 7(?) years.  But is there anything I can do to improve it while getting this debt off my back?

If I could get all of them to take 50%, I think I could drop $7,000 immediately and pay off CC1, CC3, and CC4.  Then I believe I could afford a $400/mo payment for 20 months to pay off CC2.  Should I be trying to hold onto more cash on hand?

I don't have any interest in getting into new debt, but I would like to get a credit card with a small limit (secured card?) that I could use in an emergency.

Due to COVID-related refunds and stimulus from my school, I suddenly have about $5,000 that I'm unsure what to do with. I'm considering using it to pay off some of my student loans, or paying only the interest on my loans and investing the $5,000, but I'd really like some advice!

Option 1: 

I currently have $19,000 in federal student loans (borrowing at a rate of $9,500/academic year, which will continue for another two years). $5,000 would make a considerable dent in that amount. $12,000 of what I owe is accumulating interest while I'm still in school, and the remainder will start to accumulate interest when I graduate. I currently owe $372 in interest on top of the principal. The interest rate on the loans is 5.05%, and I'm not required to start payments until I graduate in 2022. 

Option 2:

I'm considering investing the amount into a Vanguard index fund, like VTSAX. My reasoning for this is that my loans have an interest rate that's not concerningly high and don't need to be paid until I graduate.

Thankfully, my folks are more than happy and able to let me continue living at home w/ them until I have to move out -- so I don't have to worry about living expenses anytime soon. So, I figured now would be a perfect time to build credit -- and possibly w/ secured credit cards.

I'm looking at applying for both Capital One's Secured Mastercard and Discover's it Secured Card. While applying, I noticed that there are sections on both applications that ask about my employment status and income and I'm not sure what to put. I just graduated, so I'm not a student... but I haven't started my job yet, so I'm not employed. I have already accepted a job offer, so I'm not really unemployed either though. I figured I could just select the ""other"" option, since none of the other options made sense, but then I thought perhaps I was shooting myself in the foot by doing so (i.e., getting a lower credit limit than I would had I applied while I was working/getting paid). Is it acceptable for me to fill in the information of my future occupation status and salary now? If not, would it be better for me to just wait until I start working? Furthermore, if I should wait to apply for a credit card when I start working, should I even be applying for a secured credit card at that point?

I'm really confused right now and not sure what I should do. I'd really appreciate any advice! Thanks :)",Should I apply for a credit card now or wait until I start my job in 3 months?
personalfinance,"Hi everyone 

Posting here in case I’m missing something on what should be a rather simple decision. 

I have 10,000 left on my truck note with 2 years till payoff, if I keep making the min. payments of $391. 

I have the cash to pay it off in full, which is what I planned to do right after I got my most recent bonus at work. I was on credit karma the other day and it showed that of the remaining 10,000 or so, only $500 is interest. Then I thought, should I even do this if I’m only saving $500 over 2 years?

I know the rule of thumb is to determine if I can earn more than the 3.9% interest by investing the 10,000 instead, which I’m pretty confident I can. 

Of course it would be nice to have an extra 400/month  but I’m still cash flow positive by a good margin. I also find comfort in saving as much money as I can, so watching 10K disappear might be what I’m having trouble pulling the trigger on.

personalfinance,"Hi!

Long story short:

I took a 1000$ credit card when I was a student. Fulled it then never paid. 

The credit card was cancelled for bad payment 4 years ago.

The statut on my report is

""Bad Debt Write Off, Account Cancelled by Credit Grantor with Derogatory Rating""

I tried to pay it now that I works but my debt as been sold multiple times and I cant find the collection agency who own the debt.

So I dont know what to do.

I see 2 options

1) Wait till the debt is erased from credit report after 6 years so I would need to wait 2 years. 
2) Try to contest the debt and ask Equifax/Transunion to remove it but I dont know if this can be considerate as a fraud 

Option 2 scare me too because the debt was never reported by a collection agency. I have nothing in the ""collection"" section on my report. The credit card only show in ""revolving accounts"". So I am a bit scared that if I try to contest the collect agency find me and report the debt to collection on my credit report.



So TLDR: I have a 1000$ unpaid credit card closed 4 years ago, I cant find the collection agency to pay it so I have an unpaid credit card on my report and I dont know what I can do to fix that (at least a bit)

What can I do?

I graduated college 1 year ago and landed a job immediately after with an annual income of $80k a year. Since then I've been able to save ~$25k, while additionally putting away ~$8k in emergency funds and 8% of my total income in my 401k (increased my 401k contribution to 10% since the new year). I'm going to be moving back into my parents and will be saving an additional ~$650 while living there. As for debts I still have ~$25k in student loans to pay off, I currently put in ~$250 each month into my loans.

Okay so here's where I'm unsure what to do with my money. Currently, the ~$25k is sitting in my checking collecting dust. Should I put that money towards my student loans or should I put that into a ROTH IRA or something? I don't really have a use for the money right now. I feel like putting all my money towards my student loans compared to investing it in the market would be a wasted opportunity since I wouldn't be getting any sort of return on it.

It seemed like that money disappears even if it makes more later and that notion made me sad. So I never did. Finally in my late mid-30s an unexpected pandemic hit with an equally as unexpected reaction by the entire world. Markets crashed. With my experience and taking notice of the time I was finally able to leave home and start making money again I personally predicted this past's bottom. I once again was facing my constant working-life's feeling that I need to invest. I heard its murmuring and stared it in the eyes. This time I listened, ""if you feel you should do it, then do it!"" And so I did. I invested.

I took 20% of my life's savings, from that I took half and put it into Wealthfront into some retirement style thing. I took a quarter and put it into Titan a more aggressive but still fairly conservative investment, like a mutual fund thing. The rest I independently bought various shares through Robinhood. These are all mobile investment apps by the way.

Ok so since this pandemic market's bottom my independently bought shares through Robinhood have returned 12%, Titan 8%, and Wealthfront 6.5%.

I also noticed Wealthfront charges fees, not much, on their service. Yet through not much research I've managed to locate the exact stocks and ratio they've invested my funds and learned their trade philosophy. I'm new to investing so I'm wondering if it would be wise after a year, tax reasons, to take my money out of Wealthfront and do what they do myself minus their fees? Also same thing with Titan?

personalfinance,"Hello all... I've found myself in quite a pickle and was hoping you all could offer some advice on the best direction to go from here. 

This will be my first home purchase. I've saved for a down payment, researched the area, been outbid on several houses, and finally have had my offer accepted on one. The sellers are motivated to move quickly as they have another house purchase pending this sale. We are hoping to close in 3.5 weeks.

Early on in my search I was connected, through a friend, to a mortgage broker. He is the ""branch manager"" and has moved my application along and overall been very helpful. I don't know him personally except for our interactions over the past six months. 

Today I received his disclosure packet outlining the mortgage details. Today's rates must have spiked and were a quarter point higher than we had originally discussed. I know he cannot control these rates, but I tried to contact him a few times unsuccessfully. ( To be fair he normally picks up for me any time of the day). To be clear, I did not sign his disclosure 

Feeling a little panicked at the time, I figured u would reach out to my credit union to see what they could offer. After some phone tag, I was connected to the mortgage branch and an employee who took my application and approved me for a much lower rate, 3.125% instead of the 3.85% from my original lender. She said that due to the tight timeline, the appraisal may not be able to be done in time and that I would need to sign their disclosure so she could order the appraisal. 

This is where I made a mistake I believe, I went ahead and signed with my credit union without communicating to my original lender. After calling him and telling him the news, he was audibly upset that I didn't come to him first becaus he could have simply beat their rate and closing costs and refund me for any good faith money I may lose at the credit union. 

He is currently cooking up some numbers and is going to get back to me. If he comes in lower than the credit union, and all other things are equal (PMI, closing costs, down payments, et ) should I change ship again? What exactly were the disclosures that I signed ... I've heard that it doesn't mean much until you're at the closing table and signing documents then.

I have a Colorado Driver's License and am trying to file for unemployment but the colorado DOL site asks if I made any money in CO from 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2019 in Colorado, which I didn't, I spent the first 9 months of 2019 traveling.  So I say that did make money in NYC during that time and it leads me to a page with a list of phone numbers for each state that I should call. So I call the NY number and in order to file a claim in NY I need an NY Driver's License or state issued ID - which I don't have. 

What can I do? I'm sorry - this may seem like a basic question to some and I consider myself a decent googler but im stuck after sifting through page after page of FAQs and stuff I still can't seem to find an answer.

personalfinance,"Hey guys, I recently was applying for jobs on Indeed when I came upon a job titled ""receptionist/office assistant"". The person then messaged me on Indeed asking if I was still interesting in the job and asked me to send him information such as my address, phone number, and things such as how I would like to be paid.

He stated that this job is ""from home"" job and that my responsibilities would include:

  
Receiving Phone Calls from my clients when am busy.  
Making Regular Drop offs at FedEx Stores for letters meant for my clients.  
Create and modify documents using Microsoft Office.

Three days ago he sent me a package with a check for a big amount and told me to deduct my weekly pay from it and deposit it at my bank or cash it and then transfer the rest of the funds to an orphanage home via MoneyGram or bank deposit.

personalfinance,"Hi all.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently lost one of my parents, and after a stressful probate of which I was the executor, during which I sold the house and paid off other debtors, have received about $100k in cash.  I'm looking to make an intelligent choice on what to do with this one time infusion of money and appreciate advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I am fortunate to have a fairly comfortable income and do max out both my 401k and Roth IRA.  I also have a solid 9-12 months expenses of cash saved in an online savings account.  I do not currently have any taxable investment accounts.  I'm in my mid 30s and feel my job is stable in this current crisis, as long as we don't take many months or years to recover (long term government contracts).  My cash flow is about $2700 a mo after taxes, investments, and expenses (including the loan below).

&amp;#x200B;

The only debt I have besides the mortgage is a car note, $42k on it at 3.24%, with 58 months left (original term was 66mo).  The payment is $780.  I am very tempted to just pay off this debt and earn my debt free badge.  However at such a low interest rate, I am also tempted to let the loan ride and invest the $100k in a taxable brokerage account.  SPY has a 1.95% yield which does help to offset the car note.  

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't pay off the loan, I could also refi at 36mo for 2.14%.  If I put the cash into SPY, the yield would offset the interest.

&amp;#x200B;

My only hesitation is market uncertainty due to obvious reasons (record unemployment, etc).  That's why I'm also considering just paying off the loan and using the extra cash flow to slowly buy in with a taxable account, say $500 a week or something.  That way I get the benefits of cost averaging too.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?  I realize I'm relatively fortunate and really can't go wrong, it's more about optimization at this point.  Thanks for any advice.","Received cash inheritance, pay off debt or invest?"

**Past financial status (October 2018):**

I accumulated a lot of student loan debt for a failed Master's a few years ago and it took me a little over a year to get a job to start paying it back. By the time I started working in October 2018 (73k a year), I had $99,500 in student loan debt, $10,000 in credit card debt, $50,000 in stocks for a net worth around -$60,000. I live with my parents and don't pay for groceries/rent so I aggressively put money towards the debt and trying to make money with stocks.

**Current financial status:**

I now make $97,000 a year with a paycheck around $1151 a week. I also didn't put towards for a 401k until last August but am putting 10% towards that now with 4% employer match.

I sold my stocks a little after the lockdown hit (was up 65% long term and have to pay like $4,000 next year in taxes) because I assumed the market would go down, I would now have $20,000 more if I didn't do this. This was a huge mistake. I then used $8,000 of my sold stocks towards my student loan debt in April 2020.

I also took $5,500 more student loan debt because I'm doing another Master's now. It's a much cheaper program and will be around $25,000 total, they might transfer 2-3 classes from my past program as well but have to wait until next semester to see if they can. 1 course a semester will be $2,700 and hopefully my next employer will have tuition reimbursement.

I'm looking to get a new job in the next 12 months making $120,000 - $150,000 a year.

**Balances:**

* **Stocks:** $47,000 in cash, no positions (was waiting for downturn)
* **Savings:** $0
* **Student Loans:**
   * **Earnest (Refinanced $90,000):** $33,000 at 4.15%
   * **Federal:** $5,500 at 0% currently because of the pandemic
* **Credit Cards:** $2,000 (0% interest used for a big purchase of a new laptop, paying $500 a month right now)
* **401k:** $10,500

**Expenses per month:**

* **Pandemic:** $100
* **Regular life:** $750 - $1,000

How should I best use my salary every month right now to save well? The student loan debt was really stressful to me in addition to it being for a non-existent degree and a reminder of me failing.

personalfinance,"Hi, Im in the UK and have a job I have been at for maybe 15 years now that pays me X per hour, X x 1.5 for overtime above 40 hours per week. I also have an agreement with the boss for an extra £250 pre tax per fortnight (my payment frequency) as I produce more product than others (around 50% more per week.  Not bragging, just my preference to keep busy busy min-maxing stuff then see the end of the day, as well as fixing machines for other people). This is between us. He used to just put £200 on top of my wages every 2 weeks from his own account which (being a bad idea!) was obviously soon changed to £250 on top of my wages from the business account to allow for tax, both of us happy that the end result was in the ball park-ish.

So far so good.  What I have noticed are a few instances of me doing basic hours plus a few, nothing major, and the maths seeming wrong to me.  One example is after doing a 55 hr week (40 basic, before overtime) I did my sums and it seems I'm on X an hour basic, then (X x 1.1)  Another time, same thing same sums, X an hour (then X x1.3).  My wage slips always comes in saying ""unit - 1, rate - gross pay"" never any breakdown of actual hourly rate at basic hours, overtime rate at overtime hours.  After doing some basic calculations factoring in increased or reduced tax even, I was on X x 1.1 or X x 1.3 or X x 1.27 hourly wage for overtime rather than X x 1.5.  Before the whole Covid thing, one fortnight I was down between £80-£100 in my calculation. I know I should be on X then  X x 1.5   Whilst I admit a lot of this is resolved by my asking the question, the main boss has been ill for over 10 years and is happy for us to carry on under our own steam, the production manager is close to retirement and wants no aggro, so it falls to the admin lady to do more tasks than may have otherwise been her job.

Three weeks ago after 6 weeks furlough  I was asked if I wanted to come back to work which I jumped at. 3 units, 3 ppl? 100% basic rather than 80%? I'm there with bells on.  I called the admin lady up to ask if I would be getting my usual £250 pre-tax when I came back, and the answer was ""No, no, it's £200 remember"".  At this time that is fine with me, I'm grateful for it but I wonder with the past wage discrepancies, how long has she been paying me me £200 pre tax rather than £250 amoungst other things.  Also, if the way she does wages on Sage (ie. unit -1, rate -gross pay, and I would assume that is how the company record are kept), how could I even argue this?  If, as I hope I am wrong in assuming, it is over a couple of years then that adds up to an amount that for me I need to address.

As a point of purely gossip and only that, some other people at work are dubious about her and believes she likes control. Several workmates have said about how they have been told to go home as ""it's time"", then the next day been asked if the panicing customer will get their product, with the answer being ""no, tomorrow""....  Factor into all this that our basic week is 37 hours for some reason, so even 3 hours overtime is still basic pay.  A couple of years ago I was doing 70 hours a week, no issues.  Myself, I honestly don't know and treat her as I would want to be treated myself. She is a nice  person in my opinion, and we chat as normal people do. I have no dislike for her at all.

My question is, how do I even begin going about addressing this in a small company of 10 people where the 2 managers are (fairly enough) awaiting retirement pretty soon and want no aggro and the office lady strangely seems to have ultimate control without causing a whole thing, needing to look back over records of wages which will only show ""unit-1, rate-gross""?

Not the most important thing nowadays I know, lots of people are having a much worse time.  Still, I wonder how much of my wages may not have been sent to me yet...  I live alone so no shared bills etc.  I rely on overtime to make ends meet.  Now basic hours are a lot better than the 80% we in the UK are lucky enough to get, but I'm still defereing payments and falling behind.  Given that I really think I need to look at what may be a year or two of being underpaid.

My instinct is to go for the 529, but I hesitate because things change, laws change, kids interest may change, you never know.

personalfinance,"I have only ever had 2 credit cards. One had a $4600 limit, and the other only $500, making my total available credit $5100. About a year ago, due to circumstances that I won't explain because it doesn't matter, I maxed out the $4600 card. I always kept up on the payments but the creditor decided to close the account, reducing my available credit to only $500. Now, I understand that the $4600 will still show up on my credit report and that I am still responsible to pay it. That isn't an issue and I have been paying more than the minimum every month and on time. The problem is that I pulled my Transunion report recently and it shows me at over 700% credit usage. I should be at 0% since my only open card is the $500 one and it does not have a balance. I have no other lines of credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best guess is that the balance is still showing as credit card debt and the percentage is so high since my total available credit went down.  Again, the account is up to date and I'm working on paying it down as fast as possible, but I'm wondering if there is some way to have it reported differently so that it doesn't effect my credit usage percentage so badly in the meantime. Any suggestions on how to fix this, short of paying it off completely?

personalfinance,"May be a dumb question - apologies if so. Recently switched brokerages to Merrill and they're offering me a non-insignificant sum to move over more money from my retirement account to them. I'd have to hold it with them for 12 months, but could still trade it normally, and they'd give me a cash sum equivalent to a bit over 2% of the money after the fact.

Since this is better than savings accounts now, and I was planning on keeping that money in index funds anyway, I'm planning on doing it. My question is - should I look to switch brokerages approximately every year if others provide this incentive?

[IRS page about the saver's credit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit)

The website says:

&gt;The maximum contribution amount that may qualify for the credit is  $2,000 ($4,000 if married filing jointly), making the maximum credit  $1,000 ($2,000 if married filing jointly).

But I believe due to the changes to exemptions and the Standard Deduction it's not actually possible to get the maximum credit, $1,000.

Using 2019 tax numbers:

With an AGI of $19,250, and a standard deduction of $12,200 that leaves $7,050 as taxable income and taxes at $703. The Saver's Credit is a non-refundable credit meaning if you didn't pay/owe the taxes you can't get the credit on that portion. So, even if you put in $2,000, you can only get a credit of $703, right?

Then the argument can be said that if you don't use the Standard Deduction you'd owe more taxes and could deduct it, but what person who makes $19,250 has enough to itemize?

Who can prove me wrong? Also, what would the maximum credit limits actually be for each bracket of eligible people?","How is it possible to get $1,000 from the Saver's Credit?"

The problem is that he had unpaid child support and so the money on tax returns went to the Child Support Agency. The stimulus money also went to the agency recently. On the 2018 tax return, their tax filer recently said my mom was an injured spouse but they never helped her. Her husband also kept it from her because he liked the fact that my mom's and brother's money was paying his unpaid Child Support Agency.  So fast forward to today, I am helping her try to file the IRS form 8379 (injured spouse) to help get back her part of the money and the stimulus check. I have many questions:

1. How do we file the form? Digitally or paper? I read that both can be done but digital is faster, but how do you e-file a form or something like that? 
2. If we decided to fill out a physical copy of the form, do we just send it? To where exactly?
3. Who can I talk with to help fill out the form accurately? A tax filer? 
4. Is there some app or service that would make this easy? Idk like Turbotax or something like that?
5. Does she file multiple forms of 8379 for each tax year and (currently) stimulus checks lost? I heard that an injured spouse can file this form for up to three years since the tax return date.

personalfinance,"Hey guys! I was wondering if someone could point out where my math is wrong when comparing a Roth VS Traditional IRA given the same exact tax and return rate. I've read these 2 numbers should be equal, but I am not quite sure where I am going wrong.

Assumptions:

Income = 60k/yr

Tax rate (fixed now and later) = 20%

Assumed rate of return = 10%

Contributing 6k/yr for 50 years

&amp;#x200B;

Roth IRA:

Actual annual income = 60k - 20% = 48k

Contribute 6k/yr \* 50 yrs = 300,000

300,000 \* 10% return = 330,000

42,000 (leftover) \* 50 years = 2.1 M

Therefore total net worth is 2,430,000

&amp;#x200B;

Traditional IRA:

Actual annual income = 48k (math for additional money we have to invest from tax deduction is below)

Contribute 6k/yr \* 50 yrs = 300,000

300,000 \* 10% return = 330,000

Extra money from tax deduction = 20% of 6k = 1,200

Investing that 1,200 in same 10% return = 1,200/yr \* 50 yrs \* 10% return = 66,000

42,000 (leftover) \* 50 years = 2.1 M

Assuming 330,000 gets taxed at 20% = 264,000

Assuming the 6,000 profit is taxed at 20% = 4800

Therefore the total net worth here is 2.1 M + 264,000 +64,800 = 2,428,800

personalfinance,"Like the title says, my fiancé has terrible credit and I was wondering if there were any actions we can take to better it. As far as I can tell the bad factors on his account are 28 missed payments Jan-April 2018 and a very small amount in collections. We're obviously paying the collections amount immediately but I'm not sure how much that will increase his score. We're thinking about buying a house and when I talked to an agent at PNC she told me that even though my score is good his still needs to be 620 or higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

The missed payments happened over the course of 4 months when he didn't update his bank information for his student loan payments. He has 7 accounts so the missed payments compounded and now he has 28 missed payments in his history. This is bad but it doesn't seem like it should make his score this low. The only other thing I can think of is he just never managed to build a lot of credit in the first place. He doesn't have any credit cards and he had an auto loan that he paid off in 2017. Aside from that the only accounts are 20k in student loans which he has been paying off consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking that opening up a credit card could help him but his score is way too low for that. This is so immensely frustrating because he's making very good money now and has been very responsible with it for the past two years. He's been on time with all of his payments (save for a Comcast bill from our old place which, again, we are paying today) and has kept his debt-to-income ratio low.

And in the future whatever amount left needed to meet the contribution limit be taken out of the individual taxable to fund the Roth.

personalfinance,"I hope this doesn't violate the rules for personal advice, I'm not sure where else to post this to get unbiased responses and this decision has been eating me up inside. I haven't given my response to the school in almost 2 months. Giving context but my biggest gripe is the financial decision. TL;DR at bottom.

I graduated a year ago and was going to go to grad school, however I decided against it because the program I applied to wasn't that good. I moved back home with parents in the meantime. I'm studying to be a character artist for video games and have found important info: 1. There's way cheaper and better classes online 2. People working at AAA studios have noticed my work and said it's really good but 3. I still have a LOT to learn in order to get a char art job, mainly technical and it takes forever to do in general. I was given advice I could get a job in a year (if I'm working hard every day).

I applied to a MFA program at S.C.A.D where they have a good game art program, and got my professors/connections to write send recommendations for the 2nd time. It took months and after a short interview I got one of the few fellowships that turned the total tuition for 3 years from 120k+ into a little under 50k. But this doesn't include how I'd pay for food/living/etc. I'd have to work while at school or take out loans making it like 100k(?). The job I'm working towards would pay like 70-80k (and 6 figures+ eventually).

I feel this sounds stupid, but I'm scared to just reject the school offer. Once I reject it there's really no turning back. My friends/family/bf/teachers supported me going back to school, but now that I have cold feet and explained all the reasons it's not a good decision, I feel like I could be making a mistake if I try to make it on my own. Knowing I could be another year away from a job in this career makes me worried. I think my family senses it and are also worried. The months go by and I'm taking online classes but feel like I'm stuck in life cause it's a long process.

Despite this, 50k tuition debt is insane, right?? For a degree that doesn't mean anything in the eyes of employers, they just want to see my art. I was told once that ""it's a good deal for an MFA"" and that it could be good debt/an investment. I'd get some connections and be with people my age, I'd hopefully get better people skills too. I wonder if I only got the 50k and not the full-ride fellowship cause I'm not as good as I think I am, or if it's a scam. Even if I got them to lower it to 30k, is that even worth it?? Everything is telling me to dump art school, I'm learning faster on my own, but I keep wondering if I'm making the wrong choice. From an unbiased POV, the answer is supposed to be obvious right?? 

TL;DR I'm struggling to cut ties with going back to school. I want to wrap my head around how much 50k+ debt really is, it's much worse than I think right?","Afraid Masters Degree will put me in unnecessary debt, 50k is too much?"

California doesn't recognize HSAs for state tax purposes, so I'm realigning my priorities from ""max HSA first"" to ""HSA after 401k and IRA"". As I change my contributions however I'm wondering if I should also switch from traditional to Roth 401k contributions?

I'm almost certainly better off going Roth now and traditional later when I make more, right? Factors I'm unsure about:

* Living here is expensive, although I'm fairly frugal. Maxing my individual contribution limit would be easier with Traditional contributions - I moved here in January with basically no savings after moving costs and coming from a crappy job, and I make a relatively low income for a professional in the bay area for the time being. So some consideration to what I'm left with at the end of the day in more liquid assets.

* I'm unsure exactly how taxes work on Roth contributions. I believe they take my contributions pre tax now and I settle up at my marginal tax rate at the end of the year?

* I don't know what I don't know. That's what happened with the HSA, and learning that California hates them for some reason. I haven't even opened an IRA yet, and this is all new to me. 

* I have no idea how to figure out what kind of income I'll want in retirement. I don't know if it'll be at 50 or 72. I made $40k last year at 26/27, and it was the most I'd made by a pretty big margin. Always managed to stay debt free but didn't really save anything either. Having a higher income and being in a position to save are new, and frankly foreign, to me. I could reasonably be happy retiring early and getting by on half my current salary, after factoring in no longer needing to save for retirement and the other expenses you ditch when you're no longer working. Or I could be making triple what I make now in 5 years and get accustomed to a totally different lifestyle, it's not like I don't like nice things. I just have no idea.

Any guidance here? My inclination is to switch to Roth 401k contributions but I'd love feedback from people who aren't just figuring this out as they go.","Yes, another Roth vs Traditional post"
personalfinance,"I lost a few credit score points last month due to paying off my car loan and I'm trying not to lose any more. 😮 I've bought a new car but no payments made yet.

I am excited to say that two of my CCs will be at a $0 balance within the next couple of weeks. One is a store CC ($1800 limit, $65 current balance) and one is a Capital One MC ($1500 limit, $125 current balance). I'm going to snowball the payments into other debt.

Is there any impact to my credit score by having open $0 balance CCs? Does it go into my average utilization % if the balance is 0?

I don't want to do any more harm to my score. If I need to use the Capital One to pay a couple of bills every month (and pay it off monthly), then I'll do that.

So just for the heck of it, I requested $22,000 and today it was completely denied, saying they cannot extend credit to me at this time, even though my score is 720. The reasons listed are ""limited credit experience"" and ""number of recent inquiries on credit bureau report."" Furthermore, it says I have too many accounts with balances and the proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high. I assume these are my student loans, but they are individually split up into different loans because I took them out basically each semester, and furthermore, they're split up by subsidized/unsubsidized, federal/private, etc. That's why there's ""so many"".

personalfinance,"I am sure this question has been asked to death, but I figured my situation might be slightly different with COVID 19 affecting the markets these days so I'd ask anyways.

The numbers:

* Principal Remaining: $440k, 29 yrs, 3 months remaining.
* Interest rate is 3.75%
* Minimum Payment (including property tax and hoi): \~$3100.
* What I pay each month: $4300 (extra $1200 against principal)

I have around $450k invested in a brokerage account that has performed fairly well over the last 5 years. I have retirement accounts beyond this, so this money is not earmarked for anything in particular aside from just savings.

While I don't want to take all of that and just let the house eat it, I am debating using a chunk of it to pay down the principal so I can pay off the house much faster and not eat as much in interest.

**Scenario 1:** By my calculations, if I continue my current path, I'll be paid off in 15 years with a total interest cost of **$136,610.26**.

**Scenario 2:** Say I pay off $220k of the loan and keep up my monthly payments to what they are now. By my calculations, that means i'll be paid off in 7 years, with a total interest cost of **$40,689.80** on the loan, saving me nearly $100k on that $220k investment.

I'm having a hard time calculating whether this is worth it or not. In order to make it worth it, I'd have to make that $100k in 7 years on the $220k investment, which seems pretty far fetched - and then I'd have to content with the extra 7 years of payments too.

Am I missing something here at all? Is there an obvious course of action, or does this come down to personal preference? I expect the markets are going to be pretty volatile with COVID as well. It seems like if I can flip my payments on my mortgage from being mostly interest to mostly principal with the much lower principal balance, it's exponentially better for me.

I realize that the Fed, FOMO, and various other factors may cause people to feel obligated to buy into equities, but those factors don't increase the underlying value of the stocks in question. Everywhere I look, I still see companies going bankrupt or projecting depressed earnings for a good period of time. **The main reason I see people are buying stocks is that they're looking for returns created by the expectation that other people will pay more down the line.**

Nowhere do I see people projecting great earnings growth and a favorable environment given the now (more) massive amount of debt we have to service. P/E ratios have expanded. With more debt, the risks of stocks in general have also increased (liquidity =/= solvency). The Fed tried to raise rates last year just a little and markets freaked out. It feels like our economy can no longer handle higher rates of any sort. In my book, that's a HUGE warning sign, particularly given that we're already at 0%.

investing,"Hi all,
I wasn't sure which sub to post this in. My brokerage allows me to ""keep the order open for 90 days when submitting it. Please note that orders that have been partially filled will get automatically cancelled when markets close.""

Would keeping a limit buy order for 90 days be advantage, in the case there's a crash and I won't miss it?

Say Stock A is currently $100, it was around $50 around end of March but has recovered a bit. I missed my opportunity but I want don't want to miss the next crash, so I set my limit buy order for $50, and keep it open for 90 days, rinse and repeat. 

What would be the disadvantage of this, other than the stock may crash below the $50 and I may overpay for it?

investing,"1) Emotions are very important in daytrading. You have to be okay with losing the money that you put in to the market. If you value the money too much, if you are down a bit, you might sell too early when your strategy was right from the beginning.

2) You will have big losses. Daytrading is a game of variance. You will lose money. But your wins should make up for your losses over time.

3) All brokerages now sell order flow to make up for costs from commission free trading. They are all the same now whereas before one may have had a bigger advantage than the other.

4) Analysts always give advice after the fact. You want to be able to gauge what will happen before they give their opinion.

5) Technical analysis does work. You just have to be adapting and constantly aware of the new market conditions.

6) Risk vs reward is important. You have to have goals for your trades. How much am I risking to make how much. Do not just hope the stock will go up. Have a price target.

7) Daytrading is a lonely profession. It is a solo activity so you have to be okay with that.

8) Volume is key. You need to watch volume as it heavily dictates price action and where the stock will move.

American Airlines: Overstated Bankruptcy Fears

May 25, 2020 9:25 AM ETAmerican Airlines Group Inc. (AAL)14 Comments7 Likes

Summary

American Airlines is far closer to cash flow positive despite limited domestic air travel.

The market still isn't correctly factoring in the $4.1 billion PSP grant into daily cash burn rates.

The airline could approach daily cash flow breakeven at 30% capacity levels of 2019.

The stock is a buy below $10 as the airline faces limited bankruptcy risk.

Never has a stock had so many bankruptcy questions while trading near $10 per share. Yet, American Airlines Group (AAL) finds the stock in just that situation. At the depths of the virus panic and when financial aid was questionable, some bankruptcy fears were logical. But now, the more logical outcome is a return to a very profitable airline on the verge of substantial free cash flow generation. My previous research that America Airlines has plenty of breathing room is only reinforced by the resurgent passenger demand heading into the Memorial Day weekend.

Traffic Surge

The easiest path to the airline sector avoiding a bankruptcy is for traffic to return to more normal levels. When the Boeing (BA) CEO made the airline bankruptcy comment on May 12, the industry traffic was more in line with this chart from CNBC showing daily passenger levels still scrapping off the bottom down over 90% from 2019 levels.
￼Source: CNBC
On May 12, only 163K passengers went through the TSA checkpoint. On May 22, nearly 350K passengers flew on U.S. airlines. In the course of 10 days, the U.S. capacity grew from 7.5% to 12.5% of 2019 levels. The sudden launch in traffic dramatically alters the view of whether airlines end up filing bankruptcy.
When looking at the rebound in a closer view of the drop, the passenger counts are making a U-shape rebound. Again, these aren't the types of traffic rebounds suggestive of bankruptcies in the airline sector.
In the next few weeks, both Las Vegas and Florida theme parks in Orlando will reopen. The flying public will now have substantially more reasons to actually fly, breaking the mindset that people weren't flying due to fears when the issue is the lack of destinations without travel restrictions. For now, Hawaii still has a 14-day quarantine requirement until at least June 30 for people flying to the islands which naturally restricts any tourists.
China air traffic is already above 40% of pre-virus levels. Even Delta Air Lines (DAL) recently targeted a return to 50% of previous traffic levels by the end of September. The market initially ran blindly negative with the airline planning to furlough half of its pilots, but the news was actually a positive indication Delta plans to maintain the other half of its pilots due to a forecasted resurgence in demand.

Path To Breakeven

As highlighted in numerous of my articles about the airlines, the path to cash flow breakeven isn't as far away as the market thinks. The sector isn't correctly factoring in the PSP grant from the U.S. Treasury, causing an irrational view of daily cash flow burn rates. Not to mention, some of the initial cash burn numbers, including those from American Airlines, were highly inflated by refunds in the short term.

My last article provided some key figures for investors to absorb. The airline predicted ending June with a daily cash burn rate of $50 million. The number factors in booking finally catching refunds and didn't factor in the daily PSP grant of $22.5 million to cover some payroll costs. American Airlines obtained a $4.1 billion grant to cover the 183 days from April 1 to September 30.
The actual daily cash burn from operations was only forecasted in the $27.5 million range. The $50.0 million is more of a liquidity burn rate with the PSP included in the liquidity amount. The airline will eliminate those related payroll costs after September 30 assuming traffic hasn't returned to normal levels.
This amount most notably included no benefit from an improving revenue trend. Crucially, America Airlines provided this forecast back on April 30 along with the Q1 earnings call where CEO Doug Parker made the following statement regarding the revenue portion of the daily cash burn:

As a result of all that, we expect to end this quarter with approximately $11 billion of liquidity and a significant amount of unencumbered assets still in place. That forecast assumes little to no increase in demand for air travel throughout the quarter.

At the time, daily domestic passengers were only back to 120K or barely 5% of 2019 capacity levels. With reduced fares, the 5% capacity along with loyalty fees and cargo revenues likely generated between 5% and 10% of 2019 revenues.
Since April 29, traffic has already been documented as reaching 12.5% of 2019 levels. In essence, traffic levels are up 150% since American Airlines provided the daily cash burn levels which included limited expectations for increased demand.
A return to 30% of 2019 traffic levels when combined with loyalty fees and cargo revenues, American Airlines should reach at least 30% of Q2'19 revenues of $12 billion. In such a case, the airline would generate ~$40 million in revenues per day ($3.6 billion for the quarter) or somewhere around $27 million per day above the revenues from when the airline reported numbers at the end of April.
The only big question is variable costs from increasing capacity from 20% of 2019 levels to 30%. What we do know is that revenues are large enough to wipe out the cash burn and variable costs such as payroll aren't increasing because the PSP required the airlines to keep those costs elevated.
The big variable is fuel which cost the airline $2.5 billion last Q2. Additional costs such as maintenance, landing fees and selling expenses were another $1.5 billion. The $2.6 billion in other expenses are generally variable as well.

The big key here is that fuel costs are down 50% so a normalized view of those expenses are $1.25 billion. Combined with these other variable expenses, American Airlines has $5.3 billion of quarterly expenses that dip to $1.06 billion with capacity at 20% and $1.59 billion up at 30%. The $530 million in additional costs is only $5.9 million per day in June.
Revenue growth eliminates all but these additional costs from the daily cash burn rate. With these low fuel costs, capacity at 40% would actually lead to positive cash flows. The big wild card is that at 50% capacity and with jet fuel over 50% below last year's costs per gallon, American Airlines saves over $2 billion on fuel coast per quarter.
In the end, American Airlines gets really close to cash flow breakeven around 30% of previous capacity levels as long as jet fuel costs remain below half of 2019 prices above $2/gallon. The real key to investors is that the airline reduces cash burn dramatically at these capacity levels and a shareholder can sit back and relax that bankruptcy fears will completely disappear. With bankruptcy off the table, shareholders can fully participate in the eventual rebound to record travel demand that always occurs after previous virus and terrorist fears pass.

Takeaway

The key investor takeaway is that American Airlines gets rather close to operating cash flow breakeven at 30% capacity. With bookings up, the airline might actually turn the daily cash rate to positive levels by the end of June. In addition, higher capacity rates will help cut the losses by July and August.
Even without considering far better cash flow metrics due to surging travel demand, American Airlines forecasted ending June with $11 billion in liquidity. The stock has very low risk of bankruptcy here with the only possible negative outcome coming from another virus related travel shutdown. The stock is a buy here below $10.",American Airlines (AAL): Overstated Bankruptcy Fears

After some inactivity and lack of ideas, I did some research and decided to invest in a Chinese stock index. I am holding all my other positions.

investing,"Bloomberg reported last week the EU is considering incentives for auto makers to “produce and sell clean cars and investment in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles”. Specifically, the EU may 

1) propose a €20bn over next two years EU-wide Purchasing Facility for Clean Vehicles,

2) Clean Automotive Investment Fund of €40-60bn to accelerate investment in zero emission drivetrains,

3) consider doubling investment package to build 2mm public charging and alternative fuel stations by 2025, and

4) zero emission cars would be exempt from VAT.

This last one is likely the most significant because VAT can be anywhere from 17-27% (e.g. 19/20% in Germany/France). So the cost of EV ownership could be significantly improved compared to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, and could boost EV demand.

These EV incentives could also help Ford, but a growing EV mix vs. ICE would hurt its margins though.",$TSLA - some good news out of Europe for EVs

investing,"By now I assume most of you have heard about how [J Crew has filed for bankruptcy](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/861378110). The link is a great NPR Planet Money episode explaining their history and marketing choices. It seems like a great analogy for ""buy-and-hold"" style investing vs following the market. 

J Crew used to be, as the interview calls them, ""affordable for almost-rich people"". They were doing fantastic from the 80s to the mid-2000s with this branding. Then around 2008 they started trying to up their image and sell more expensive items, like $2500 dresses. This alienated some of their core customers, but they thought it'd lead to higher average sales amounts. A few years later, they realized they couldn't afford this and tried to cut costs on their core best-selling items, which lost both some of their newer and older customers. My understanding is that they've basically tried to follow the markets of fashion and get in on what they think is trendy at the moment. 

We can compare this to brands like Lululemon or Patagonia for example - I think there's a certain branding image or type of consumer that we all think of with both of these, because they've stuck to that market despite any fashion short-term swings in what's trendy.

I think this is a great analogy for the ""follow the market"" investor vs the ""buy and hold"" investor. One investor chooses their risk tolerance and identifies individual companies or industries they'd like to invest in long-term, and holds them without trying to time the day-to-day market. For example, Warren Buffet and AXP/AAPL, or Patagonia making the same fleece sweater for decades. The J Crew investor looks at what's done well recently, like we might see with people getting into TSLA/AMD/SHOP, based on their past 6 months' performance rather than analysis of the company's outlook.

investing,"Stock prices were propelled upward last week due to two key announcements. Last Sunday, Jerome Powell said the central bank still has plenty of ammunition to help the markets and economy. Then, Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) announced positive data on their COVID vaccine on Monday morning. This combination of news drove the S&amp;P 500 increase by 3.2% over the course of the week. With all this good news, can we expect more? Here are the details:

1. **On Sunday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed is not out of ammunition 'by a long shot', driving premarket trading.** Last Sunday, on ""60 Minutes,"" Jerome Powell told the interviewer that ""we're not out of ammunition by a long shot,"" referring to a large sum of unused funds that have been allotted to fight COVID. Simply put, Powell plans on continuously infusing money into the economy to attempt to save small business from closing and permanently reducing the number of jobs available. Index futures traded significantly higher the same night.  
2. **The next morning, Moderna released positive interim P1 data for their COVID vaccine, pushing stocks further upwards.** The morning after, Moderna announced positive data on their COVID vaccine. The biotech company demonstrated generation of anti-COVID antibodies in patients without significant side effects. The company plans on starting their pivotal P3 clinical trial in July, which, if successful, will lead to a much faster economic recovery with everyone's concerns of infection put at ease.
3. **On Thursday, over 2M Americans filed unemployment claims, but investors remain optimistic over economic reopening.** As usual, the announcement of an additional 2.4M Americans filing for unemployment claims did not shake the market. Through our small sample size of consumer research, we have found that many are not working because of high unemployment benefits during COVID. Restaurants are worried about reopening because there may not be enough supply of workers to hire from in order to reopen their shops successfully. While more continue to file for unemployment claims, investors are confident that many will be able to sustain on government support and will reengage with the economy as it reopens. 
4. **To date, all but three states have either reopened to a degree or plan on reopening soon.** The final three states that have yet to open and do not have set plans to open are Illinois, Delaware, and New Jersey. As the weather gets better, more people are out and about waiting for takeout at their favorite local restaurants and eating the food in grassy public areas. So far, the U.S. government has not identified any spikes in COVID cases in states that have reopened. 
5. **With states reopening and the weather improving, airport travel jumps to a two-month high, indicating economic activity.** With summer around the corner and COVID concern dying down, travelers are getting back into the air. This Friday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a two-month high in airport travelers. While this number is still down 88% from a year ago, increase in air travel demonstrates confidence in ability to combat COVID.

**With the Feds' confidence in the economy and Moderna's exciting vaccine announcement, where does that leave the markets?** WX Capital was confident that positive news would outweigh negative news in May, but now that positive news is relatively commonplace, we believe the market may recover at a much slower pace. We expect a successful economic reopening with limited spikes in COVID cases and believe that vaccine development for COVID is more of a matter of when rather than if. We also believe that biotech will likely be the industry with the greatest return potential in the near future.",5/25/2020: Weekly Wrap-up &amp; What to Expect

I would appreciate your thoughts on what will be my first ever portfolio, to begin my investing life.

it's very simple : 

3 companies:
- Berkshire Hathaway 50%
- Visa 25%
- MasterCard 25%

long term thinking (10/20 + years)

will add to positions &amp; invest cautiously in new companies in the coming months and years, I'm only 19 years old so hopefully will have plenty of time ahead of me :)

still keeping an emergency fund, but I'll be investing quite a lot of my money as I don't expect to need the cash. I also want to be relatively low risk in these investments as I would even be happy with 4% growth per year.
I know that Buffett has received a lot of criticism recently, but I love the company for its fortress-like stability and earnings safety from insurance, energy etc wholly owned business.
as for Visa and MasterCard, they're still below pre-covid price levels, and I feel very very strongly that the move away from cash has only been accelerated, added to opportunities for expansion in developing countries such as Africa. also they're both huge companies, and trading at a much lower PE ratio than Paypal.

investing,"With the pandemic forcing many employees to work from home, many companies, including some high profile ones, have decided to give employees the option to continue working remotely even after the pandemic ends. I think this was a general, slow trend over the last decade, but with the closure of many offices suddenly, it has kicked the trend into high gear. Companies can save money by downsizing their office space, employees no longer need to commute, etc. I think it's a good bet that this is here to stay.

Ive had stocks for about 2 years now, just a few thousand work in GOF (for dividends) and ATVI back when the stock was sitting at \~50 USD per share. I was thinking about investing in REIT stocks while the shares are lower, dividends are good, but of course looking for stuff to keep long term.

A bit of background on me, Im in my early 20's and in the military. Thanks to the military I dont have many living expenses, rent and food are paid, and all I really do for entertainment is play games and live in solitude (great money saver).

Since I am in the military, and I can bank most of my money, I have over 20k, sitting between a couple bank accounts. It seems like a waste to keep money in a bank making less interest than inflation, but due to my not needing much money to survive due to my job, how much would you recommend investing in. 

The only things that I come out of pocket for are basic things like phone, internet, 1-2 streaming services, and maybe 1-2 games a month, so easily under 1k expenses per month, but I dont want to spend all of it if that makes sense.

I apologise if this questions seems basic, but I'm interested in getting some outside opinions here. Thanks in advance for any replies.",How much money would you suggest to keep in a bank account?

Potentially dumb question:

I'm considering TEC and XMTM (MTUM) however, both heavily weigh tech (and TEC is purely technology) and they have a high correlation. By going with both, I access two ETFs that I believe in and get access to XMTM's other sectors. 

Here is my example portfolio for additional context:

* 40% XAW
* 20% TEC (also considering ZNQ (QQQ)) which would lower my tech exposure.
* 20% XMTM

Does it mean that exactly in march 5 years forward there is something bad going to happen?  Because that would follow the logic of being ""priced in"".

Or why would else prices dip so much in the span of few weeks? I mean if prices today reflect growth in 5-10 years then the prices should not go down at all, as every analysis predicts that economy is going to be growing for a long time. Nothing that happens now should affect prices today, only what can happen in 5 years should affect stock prices today. So if today we know that in 5 years everything is going to be worse, then today the prices should be falling. But there is no reason to think that 5-10 years our economy is going to be worse.

&gt; … when the coronavirus pandemic started forcing the U.S. economy to shut down in late February, the stock market tanked for the next month. By late March, it was down 34%. But then, even though the economy has kept getting worse and worse, the U.S. stock market has started to recover. It rebounded in a big way so that now it is only down 13% from where it was in February before the recession started. … And meanwhile, millions of workers keep losing their jobs each week. …  the stock market did beat the real economy to what was happening, and it reprised really quickly. And then all of a sudden, it became a battle of the composition of the stock markets.
… the whole stock market collapsed when coronavirus started hurting the U.S. economy, but then some stocks of companies started recovering even as others continued to struggle.
…  it just so happens that the companies that are the best positioned for the environment we find ourselves in and what we will find ourselves in over the next six months to a year, the companies that are best positioned happen to already be the largest weighted components of the indices.
…  companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet, a.k.a. Google - are also some of the most valuable companies in the country. In fact, just those five companies make up about 20% of the entire S&amp;P 500 … when those five stocks do well, they can help pull up the whole index.
…  First markets dropped in panic sell. Then  companies who don't suffer from the pandemic recovered and the composition of index changed.  Big tech companies happen to be already large part of market cap of SP500, so they bring up the SP500 as a whole. 
…  aside from Amazon, which has almost a million workers, a lot of these companies don't actually employ that many people. Microsoft only has 144,000 workers. Facebook has just 48,000 workers. And this can partly explain why tens of millions of people can lose their jobs while the stock market keeps going up.

investing,"Inflation in Belgium is slowing down the last few months, due to very low demand. Because it is a rather unpredictable and volatile market time, I'm wondering what would happen if we either enter a strong deflation period, or if it somehow flips into a strong inflation period. Because many sources keep saying this crisis looks like it could become worse than the Great Depression, I tought I'ld have a look into some historical figures.

In Belgium there is a public backlog of evolution of prices up to 1920. You can download the excel sheet [here](https://statbel.fgov.be/nl/open-data/consumptieprijsindex-en-gezondheidsindex). The inflation columns is MS\_CPI\_INFL.

The inflation/deflation has been very stable for many decades. Last periods it shifted sharply was:

\- in the 80's and 70's (very high inflation 7-15%: mainly because of oil crisis).

\- years surrounding world war 2, because... bombs.

But even further back, we get to the interesting part: before, during and after the great depression. In the 1920's inflation was insane out of control with 25-48 %, but after the great crash we entered a strong deflation era with up to 11,6 % deflation.

My question, because I have clearly never liver through times with strong inflation or deflation: what is to be expected of such periods, marketwise? Does it make sense to hoard cash to be able to invest when inflation picks up again? Does it make sense to invest when deflation is at a suspected peak? Especially if not stockpicking but investing in ETF's? Should it be something to worry about at all, because unlike the Great Depression: we didn't have an enormous inflation build up in prior years that could deflate.",What's the effect of strong inflation or deflation?

investing,"This is not a promotion thing or anything. I started using Atom Finance last week and I’ve found that I much prefer it over Yahoo Finance. Yahoo has a good looking app, but Atom looks even nicer, and provides better and more valuable information. First of all, news is much easier to find, and is better news in general. By ‘better’ I mean that it’s not sketchy and I don’t ever see speculative stuff like “why this stock is poised to 10x over the next year” like I see over at Yahoo. Secondly, Atom provides even better information about companies than Yahoo. For example, Atom displays financial data over the last 5 years rather than just 3 on Yahoo Finance. Also, company documents such as animal reports are available and easily accessible right on the app. Anyways, just wanted to put this out there for anyone looking for a good news or stock tracker app.",Atom Finance is better than Yahoo Finance

investing,"**Core Business:** Nestle's products need no introduction so let's just name the big 3 - Maggi, KitKat and baby milk powder. Out of these, baby milk powder is key. Let's look into that.

**Competitive moat:** Nestle dominates the baby milk powder segment with 97% share in the market. A deep dive into the financials of Nestle reveals one more interesting bit - baby milk powder contributed to nearly 80% of the free cash flows of the company.

The milk powder segment is a huge cash cow that just cannot be usurped. Like Page, the FMCG model generates large amounts of cash and essentially a negative working capital cycle.

Why is that no one can compete with Nestle in the baby milk powder segment? Simple - In the late 90s, India changed the rules about how baby milk powder is classified - it is now considered a prescription drug (it was classified as an FMCG earlier).

What does that do?

* *Prescription drugs cannot be advertised* \- Abbott's Similac may be a better product. But Abbott cannot market it since advertisement is not allowed. No other new manufacturer can advertise its product to compete with Nestle and grab any market share.
* *No new licenses* \- The Government has stopped giving new licenses for baby milk powder. This is because the WHO has said that mother's milk is best for infants. Again, this means that no new manufacturers can enter the market.
* *Prescription drugs can be sold only at pharmacies* \- So baby milk powder cannot be sold at a Kirana store or Super market or similar. Baby milk powder is the highest margin product for a pharmacy. There is no bargaining from customers, no discount and only one supplier - Nestle.

A company such as Nestle will perform even in the most adverse of times. No Covid-19 can stop parents from feeding their children milk. Don't take our word for it - Nestle recorded 10.8% sales growth in Q4FY20 - when the Covid-19 stress was starting to accelerate. Expect decent growth even in Q1FY21.

We've done a full analysis of Nestle here -  [https://www.thegalacticadvisors.com/post/nestle-india-the-unassailable-monopoly](https://www.thegalacticadvisors.com/post/nestle-india-the-unassailable-monopoly)",Analysis of Nestle India stock

investing,"Here's something that's been bugging me for a while, hoping someone can lend some insight.

Consider two companies:

**Company A** is in a growth industry and is profitable. It has been returning 10%/yr for the last few years and has plowed that profit back into its business (building data centers or whatever).

**Company B** is also a profitable, well-run business, but it's in a saturated industry (maybe healthcare?) and has fewer growth opportunities. Because it's well-run, it has a decent profit margin, and its shareholders reap the rewards of investing in this business. It also has been returning 10%/yr in total, 4% of which have been paid out to shareholders in dividends, and the remaining 6% has been plowed back into the business.

Assuming we're using a tax-advantaged account, and assuming I can reinvest in Company B for zero transaction costs, the difference between the two companies is absolutely nothing. Yet if I invest in a cap-weighted ETF, I get far more of Company A than of Company B.

From my point of view, the only difference between the two companies is that when investing in Company B, I get to decide where I reinvest my dividends. When investing in Company A, that choice is taken away from me.

I get that cap-weighted funds are easier to manage because the balance is maintained automatically by the price movement of stocks, but is that enough of a reason to move my investments more into Company A than Company B?

And what if Company B actually has a better total return over the last 20 years than Company A? Using a market-cap-weighted ETF, they would not be rewarded for that outperformance, whereas Company A would.

Is this a fundamental flaw of market-cap weighting? Or am I overthinking it? Is there another way to weight companies by total return yet still distribute their dividends from the fund?",The weight of dividend-payers in cap-weighted indexes

investing,"Hi everyone!

I’m considering making some changes to my portfolio and figured I’d run this here as there’s lots of wisdom around :)

Long story short, my wife and I (42) are saving every month into an account with a Roboadvisor in Germany (I know we could have it cheaper but for now I’m in happy on the commodity it provides us). We’re doing for us (deposit 1) and for our two kids (6 and 9, deposits 2 and 3).

For us, we don’t plan to pull any money, it’s cooking for retirement, which gives us around 25 years of time. For the kids will probably a bit less, let’s say 8-10 years.

The portfolio is currently at 50% stocks and 50% bonds, and I’m thinking on pivoting to 70% stocks and 30% bonds to the three deposits, taking into account we have enough time to beat volatility and take advantage of the compound.

Would you see an issue doing this now, in these uncertain COVID times? The bonds are pretty much keeping my portfolio losing ~5,5% whereas more stocks would mean more loses, however it really doesn’t matter because I don’t plan to cash out anyways. Am I missing anything?

Retail landlords are sending out thousands of default notices to tenants, a situation that could tip already-ailing retailers into bankruptcy or total collapse.

Department stores, restaurants, apparel merchants and specialty chains have been getting the notices as property owners who’ve gone unpaid for as long as three months lose patience, according to people with knowledge of the matter and court filings.

“The default letters from landlords are flying out the door,” said Andy Graiser, co-president of A&amp;G Real Estate Partners, whose firm works with retailers and other commercial tenants. “It’s creating a real fear in the marketplace,” Graiser said.

Pressure from default notices and follow-up actions like locking up stores or terminating leases was cited in the bankruptcies of Modell’s Sporting Goods and Stage Stores Inc. Many chains stopped paying rent after the pandemic shuttered most U.S. stores, gambling that they could hold on to some cash before landlords demanded payment.
Skipping Rent

Mall landlords received just a quarter of expected April rent payments

The stakes are enormous, and landlords are suffering, too. An estimated $7.4 billion in rent for April hasn’t been paid, or about 45% of what’s owed, according to data analyzed by CoStar Group.

“If the landlords don’t put a pause on their actions, you’re going to see more bankruptcies,” Graiser said.

To be sure, not every default letter is followed by a padlock on the door. In some cases, landlords are sending letters just to preserve their legal rights while they talk with their tenants.

Simon Property Group Inc. says it’s in discussions with merchants at its malls and trying to take into account their financial status, market position and the depth of their relationship. “The bottom line is, we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid,” Chief Executive Officer David Simon said during the company’s May 11 earnings call.
No Payments

But the landlords are stuck with their own bills and bank debts to pay. By some measures, they’ve already been more than patient. Normally, they’d send out default notices as soon as 10 days after missed payments, rather than waiting weeks or months.

“The landlords do have the legal contract,” said Vince Tibone, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors. “However, from a practicality standpoint, a lot of these retailers are on the brink of bankruptcy and simply cannot pay right now.”

Batches of default notices went out to Stage Stores before it filed for court protection this month, according to court papers. It didn’t pay rent in March, April or May after shuttering its stores and furloughing almost all its staff.

The letters began arriving in March and early April, “but the rate of such notices picked up materially in late April and early May,” Stage Stores said. Some landlords began locking the company out “and threatened to evict the debtors and dispose of the in-store inventory.”

“Responding to and managing these default notices and related litigation outside of Chapter 11 would have been a monumentally difficult task,” Stage Stores said.

Index of regional mall REITs reflects tough times for landlords

For those already weighing bankruptcy, shutdowns caused by the pandemic upended normal calculations. Filing for Chapter 11 allows retailers to reject unwanted leases, but they’re also required to keep paying rent during the process until the court approves the cancellations.

That’s hard to do with little or no revenue coming in because of the pandemic shutdowns. Even if the stores can open, consumers may be hesitant to shop, making it hard to raise cash from stores that are meant to survive the bankruptcy or from going-out-of-business sales.

Retailers need adequate liquidity at the start of a bankruptcy case to keep operating, Graiser said, and if they have to pay rent while their stores are shuttered, the odds of emerging decrease.

“It’s not like there’s a lot of investors out there looking to buy retailers in a Chapter 11,” Graiser said. “Landlords and retailers need to really come together and realize that this a shared pain.”
Getting Testy

Some landlords get it, according to Tom Mullaney, managing director of restructuring at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., the real estate services firm. Retailers he represents are getting default letters that are understanding and sympathetic; other landlords strike a more combative tone.

What’s more interesting is the action, or lack of it, by the landlords afterward, Mullaney said. “In a lot of cases, the letters that are being sent aren’t being followed up on,” he said -- the landlords are simply preserving their legal rights.

That said, some property owners have run out of patience and have locked out Mullaney’s clients.

“The environment is getting pretty testy and emotional on both sides of the table,” he said. “The only thing worse than being a retailer right now is being a retail landlord.”",Commercial Tenant Defaults start Rolling In -- Structured Products and Collateral Pain To Follow

investing,"I’ve been reading several books such as bogleheads guide to investing and random walk down Wall Street along with many internet articles, and while they educate you on just about everything when it come to investing it seems like in the end they come to the conclusion that index investing is the smartest way to get the most out of your investments in the long term.

investing,"Caveat: this lesson applies to shorter-term trading, not long-term investing.

When I think back over my most common trading mistakes, one of the first ones that comes to mind is pulling the trigger too quickly.  In the early days, when I was strictly swing trading using technical analysis, the following was a common occurrence: I would buy a stock based on a technical breakout signal and then get frustrated as the stock either pulled back quickly or floundered. I would then assume it was a false breakout and sell, only to watch the stock rocket higher in the ensuing days.  I've lost count of the number of times I've said, ""If only I had waited a few more days.""

My most costly investing mistake was caused by an itchy trigger finger - not in terms of money lost, but in terms of potential profit lost.  It wasn't a ""quick"" decision per se, but it was yet another example of not allowing time for things to play out.  It was back in the early summer of 2011, and after recovering strongly following the 2008 crash the markets were getting choppy.  I recall driving to work and hearing talk on the radio every day about the debt crisis in Europe and the risk it posed to the US economy.  I didn't really understand the issue but I do remember feeling an impending sense of doom.  So I decided to short the markets.  I sold most of my long positions and put a bunch of money into a triple leveraged VIX ETF and a leveraged inverse Nasdaq ETF.  And then I waited.

It didn't take long for things to start playing out in my favor.  In early June, 2011, the Nasdaq dropped pretty sharply, losing about 8% over a two-week period.  ""Yes!"" I thought to myself. ""I nailed it, I'm going to make a killing!""  If you look at a chart of the Nasdaq during that period, you'll notice that the Nasdaq recovered very quickly and gained back what it had lost in about the same amount of time.  It made a new high and was testing all-time highs.  My thought process went like this: ""Damn, is that it?  I guess the 8% drop is all we're going to get.  If the markets are going to keep climbing, I better close all my short positions.""  And so I did.

Now if you look back at that 2011 chart again, you'll see the Nasdaq pull back briefly from that new high and make a small bounce to just below the recent high.  And then the bottom fell out - the Nasdaq proceeded to drop almost 20% in 9 trading days.  I was literally two weeks from making a killing. Because I had closed my short positions two weeks before, at the new high, I ended up selling those positions for a small loss instead of a massive gain.  Two bloody weeks.

One of the contributing factors was my lack of experience.  I didn't have enough experience with, and understanding of the markets to know that strong rallies are very common in bear markets and that tops and bottoms are processes, not events.  But a big contributing factor was my lack of patience, driven in no doubt by the loss-aversion bias.  This is a psychological ""trick"" our minds play on us to make losses feel much worse than gains feel good.  When I saw the Nasdaq recover quickly from the 8% drop and my gains quickly get erased, I started to fear that the markets would keep going up and I would start losing more and more money.  So I bailed.  If only I had waited two weeks...

So my advice is this: Wait.  The first time you have the instinct that you should pull the trigger on a trade, wait.  Just watch it for a bit.  You'll catch false breakouts, avoid selling prematurely, and in some cases even avoid major losses.  You have to wait for signals to confirm and patterns to play out.  And forcing yourself to wait will help overcome emotional trading driven by fear and cognitive biases.  Sure, you'll miss out on some profits this way too; but as a general rule it will help you much more than it will hurt you.",Valuable lesson #1: Wait. Patience really is a virtue.

investing,"I am trying to convince myself that I should increase my nonexistent international exposure in my portfolio and having trouble. Here is why:

1. I am an American and will live in America my entire life. When America's economy is in a recession and my portfolio suffers, pretty much everyone else in the USA will be in the same boat so my net worth and purchasing power relative to others will be relatively unchanged.
2. Even if I invest in foreign economies, when the US has a financial crisis the world economy will be dragged down with it defeating the purpose of diversification. The SP500 already gives me multinational exposure. 
3. What foreign economies would I even invest in? Sure, international index funds would give me broad exposure, but it is essentially broad exposure to inferior markets compared to the USA. China, the worlds 2nd largest economy, is a bad actor on the international stage and I want nothing to do with their dubious economy. Other countries who have strong futures (e.g. Canada, Australia) simply mirror the US economy.
4. The USA has enormous room for growth given vast natural resources and enormous size. And unlike other enormous countries (Russia, China, etc), the USA is a democratic country. 
5. I don't see American consumerism changing anytime soon.
6. The American people have a unique DNA, just about everyone here is an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants who left their home country seeking better opportunities with hard work. This has a profound impact on the country's mindset and bodes well for the future. Not only that, but the profound ethnic diversity of the USA creates a melting pot of ideas unlike any other economic power. 
7. The US dollar is the most desired currency around the world.
8. The geopolitical strength of the US is unparalleled.
9. The US  has the infrastructure to continue to be the center for technologic and biomedical advancement.
10. Anyone who has bet against the USA over the last 2.5 centuries has lost.
11. America is lagging behind the times politically and likely always will in terms of social support programs. This is bad for humanism but good for US capitalism and the SP500.
12. VEURX has underperformed VFINX pretty much always for the last 30 years, by a significant margin. I don't see any indication that the EU will outperform the US anytime soon.
13. Immigrants still want to be American citizens, even the best and brightest of other countries. There is still no better place to be in business, healthcare, engineering, IT, science, education, etc.
14. The entertainment industry has been and will continue to be dominated by the USA. I would argue California alone has had more cultural impact over the last few decades than any other country. 
15. The US economy is backed by the strongest military in the world. And unlike  historical world powers that have failed, The US military is run by a democratic nation. 

These are 15 reasons I think the future of the US economy is unrivaled. I can't think of a single reason to invest in a foreign economy aside from diversification for diversification sake. Any thoughts?",Why I currently don't have international index funds

investing,"I'll preface this by saying I know next to nothing about the bond markets and how to evaluate them.  My question is for people that are knowledgeable about the bond markets.

Could we see a spike in bond yields soon?  I am wondering if there were a ""semi failed"" treasury auction soon that would place at 500 basis points or more higher than expectations that would precipitate a general repricing, particular in the lowest tier corporate tranches.  Or maybe the series of bankruptcies we're about to see would cause this.

Is there simply too much demand for safety in treasuries that this is extremely unlikely to happen?  I would imagine that the appetite for US treasuries from China and Japan would be very low right now, but there is probably a lot of increased demand domestically, and from a lot of the rest of the world.

investing,"Hi all,

I am currently building a sortino ratio optimized passive portfolio that matches the returns of SP500 but has less risk than the index, or at-least that is the idea. Now I wanted to examine the risk return characteristics of the SP500 so I can calculate its own sortino ratio. I then noticed that the only yearly return I can get for the SP500 is something like 6%, which is strange as when I am looking up various articles on the SP500 they are stating that the yearly return is a bit below 10% (the number that gets mentioned often is 9.8%).

So if I take the SP500 Adj. close data from Yahoo finance (thus accounting for any dividend distributions) my first data point becomes 30/12/1927 at 17.66 and my last data point becomes 31/12/2019 at 3230.78 (I don't want the current crisis to have influence on my calculation as most of the articles I read that claim the return is on average 10% are from before 2020.

So first I calculate my total return which is = (3230.78 - 17.66) / 17.66 = 181.94

As the next step I annualize the return = (181.94 + 1)^(1/(2019-1927)) - 1 = 0.058 = 5.8%

investing,"Anybody read his book? Still on the search for a valuation method that I can become comfortable with, but unfortunately his failed. 

It does not make sense, or doesn't work in practice. I liked the idea, and was disappointed to discover that reality doesn't align. I'm slowly losing faith in anchoring my valuations on the idea of book value growth. 

Basically, he takes a large and stable company like Johnson &amp; Johnson, and tracks its book value per share for the past 10 years (he did '02-'12). Over 9 years, the average book value growth is 12.1%.  It's book value per share is approximately $20.95 at the time. There are a number of other conservative assumptions he made (e.g. Dividends), but his core method is based on making an assumption on book value growth.

You can also find this method and plug in numbers on his website: [https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/intermediate-course/lesson-21/](https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/intermediate-course/lesson-21/)

Long story short, he comes to the conclusion that if you had bought JNJ for $76.20 in 2012, you could expect a 1.71% return on your investment over the next ten years (1.71% was the 10 year 10-note in 2012), assuming that book value continues to grow at 12.1%. This was trading at $65 in 2012. 

8 years has passed, so I was curious and looked how JNJ actually did. Share price sky-rocketed - JNJ closed $144.37 today. The percentage return (based on a purchase price of $76.20), especially when you factor in dividends, is obviously much greater than an annualized return of 1.71%.

So naturally, I thought they must have grown its book value tremendously vs. expectations. But no, its book value per share since 2012 has not grown at all, as it is approximately $23 per share today. Literally \~0% growth. If you plug in 0% book value growth btw, you get an intrinsic value of $38 per share.

Should valuations anchored on book value growth be thrown out completely? Please let me know how I should think about this, as I'm incredibly frustrated with this particular example. 

Took a quick look at their balance sheet history, and this is driven by the fact that while their earnings did continue to increase, so did their liabilities. So their book value did not grow.",Preston Pysh's Valuation Example of JNJ in his Warren Buffett Book

investing,"""The investigational antiviral remdesivir is superior to the standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19, according to a report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. The preliminary analysis is based on data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The randomized, controlled trial enrolled hospitalized adults with COVID-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement (generally moderate to severe disease). Investigators found that remdesivir was most beneficial for hospitalized patients with severe disease who required supplemental oxygen. Findings about benefits in other patient subgroups were less conclusive in this preliminary analysis.

The study began on Feb. 21, 2020 and enrolled 1,063 participants in 10 countries in 58 days. Patients provided informed consent to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive local standard care and a 10-day course of the antiviral remdesivir intravenously, developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or local standard care and a placebo. The trial was double-blind, meaning neither investigators nor participants knew who was receiving remdesivir or placebo.

The trial closed to enrollment on April 19, 2020. On April 27, 2020 (while participant follow-up was still ongoing), an independent data and safety monitoring board overseeing the trial reviewed data and shared their preliminary analysis with NIAID. NIAID quickly made the primary results of the study public due to the implications for both patients currently in the study and for public health. The report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine describes the preliminary results of the trial.

The report notes that patients who received remdesivir had a shorter time to recovery than those who received placebo. The study defined recovery as being discharged from the hospital or being medically stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. The median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. The findings are statistically significant and are based on an analysis of 1059 participants (538 who received remdesivir and 521 who received placebo). Clinicians tracked patients’ clinical status daily using an eight-point ordinal scale ranging from fully recovered to death. Investigators also compared clinical status between the study arms on day 15 and found that the odds of improvement in the ordinal scale were higher in the remdesivir arm than in the placebo arm. Trial results also suggested a survival benefit, with a 14-day mortality rate of 7.1% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.9% for the placebo group; however, the difference in mortality was not statistically significant.

Ultimately, the findings support remdesivir as the standard therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen therapy, according to the authors. However, they note that the mortality rate of 7.1% at 14 days in the remdesivir arm indicates the need to evaluate antivirals with other therapeutic agents to continue to improve clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19. On May 8, 2020, NIAID began a clinical trial (known as ACTT 2) evaluating remdesivir in combination with the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib compared with remdesivir alone.""

investing,"The S&amp;P 500 has an annualized compound growth since inception of about 10%. My question is, Can this go on forever? For instance, does anyone think compound interest will have an indefinite rally in the stock market? For the next 40 years or 80 years or 600 years, will the market continue to compound on top of itself indefinitely? Or will there ever be a maximum or a ceiling that no matter how good the economy grows, there will be an end to how high the stock market will ever reach? If compound interest will never stop, it seems like eventually, even investing 1 dollar, will ultimately result in billions of dollars. Yes it will take hundreds or maybe a few thousand years, but it will happen eventually. It seems like realistically there might be a permanent collapse along the way somewhere, or a massive slow down in compounding growth, as in no matter how much money is poured into the markets, it will barely nudge the market any higher.

investing,"I’ve been talking to people I know about investing I asked them two questions. 1) What kind of accounts do you use to keep your money. If they didn’t mention a TFSA I wouldn’t ask anymore questions if they did I would ask 2) Do you invest?

DISCLAIMER:
Me and these people are good buddies, we rip on each other and joke around I wasn’t asking people I met on the street and when I asked I wasn’t a grand inquisitor it was just a regular conversation while hanging out. Also, it’s their money and they can do what they want with it, this is just my opinion on it.
——————

There’s three types of people I know in my area of contacts. 1) Those who leave all their money in a chequing account (checking account in USA). 2) Those who have a HISA (high interest savings account if you can call 0.2% high) and put some money in there and 3) Those who have a chequing account, a HISA and a TFSA.

The first are pretty mind blowing when I was told by two people they only having one account and it’s a chequing account and all there money goes in there because 1) They get absolutely no interest and 2) they lose money to just have the account every money from fees. I don’t even understand the thinking, they just told me it’s easy to just have one account so they don’t have to transfer funds when they want to buy something.

The second have a chequing and a HISA, these people are a step up above the only chequing account guys. They put what they can into the HISA to save up for large purchases and retirement. The problem is they aren’t making anything in terms of interest, sure banks have a 2% for 3 months but then it’s down to 0.2% (my bank as an example). These ones are more short term thinking as in they only think about the next car or home or new furniture but not long term. They just don’t care at all and basically “I live in the moment.”

The third have a chequing, HISA and TFSA, this one is pretty mind blowing. So they have a chequing for spending, a HISA for saving money for big purchases and a TFSA... you’d think to invest right?... Well I ask, so do you invest? Answer: NO. They use it as a savings account as well but that’s it! The thing that’s mind blowing is that it’s COMPLETELY TAX FREE! I think in an IRA you need to pay tax when putting money in (I’m not sure I’m in Canada) but in Canada using a TFSA everything and I mean everything is tax free (if you invest in Canadian securities). So they basically max their TFSA contribution just to have a glorified savings account earning 2%.

Why do they not invest? Well they told me. The answer is: “Because investing is risky and I wouldn’t know where to start.” So I tell them no problem I can recommend a beginner book. They (except one) say “I don’t want to read books.”

BUT one of my friends did ask me to recommend a book and he bought it (bogglehead investing book if you’re wondering) and now I’m talking to him about investing. So I’m happy to say I’ve converted one of them!

Anyway the point of this post wasn’t to point and say “these losers don’t invest and I do, I’m better than them!” But I just wanted to share my experience in understanding my friends and how they view money.

I spent the last months reading what people of WsB are doing and i am shocked.(what a surprise eh?) 
Recently they are complaining cause they believe the market is not acting properly. Maybe they should read Benjamin Graham before complaining about the market. 
Said so, I've been investing since I'm 18, always trying to use logic, and since then always got 4% net return on my capital, which at the time was more than enough for me. Recently i started investing in more complex thing and since Corona I've increased my capital by 43.8%.
Why I'm saying this? Cause i believe that studying is important, knowing where you are putting your money is important, investing is not betting, investing is capital growth via compound interest, capital generates capital. This is what most of this people don't understand.
Practical example : January 2020 i freed 15.000 € of low i investments, cause i was expecting a recession for 2020, i was searching at the time for some nice corporate bonds for a long time investment, one of those which i pre selected just bases on interest, yield and year was Hertz 6% 2028. Then i started the second phase of my investment routine, i downloaded the financial reports and went straight to the current ration and debt of the company, which was absolute dog shit, therefore, no investing in Hertz.

investing,"I have spent the last year studying, learning, reading, watching videos, asking peers about investing. Here is where my perspective is and would love some engagement:

**Index Funds:**

To this day Buffett said we should ""bet on America"" which in my opinion means that the average investor should invest in an s&amp;p 500 index fund. By doing this you have the ability to make 8-10 percent on your money on an annual average over the course of long term. Being 30 years old, I have been investing in my 401K for 7 years now and also have a Roth IRA with FXAIX as my main position. 

My question is, is this approach still relevant in today's market especially post Covid 19? With all of these big tech companies growing vastly it's difficult to resort to this strategy when the impression is that there is so much more opportunity picking individual stocks. I guess i am interested in understanding how other investors are making the decision going with the passive index route or looking for individual stocks to gain a potential 15 percent a year. 

Personally, I think there is a lot of investors that are new to the market that are hoping to have the market be there main source of income. I am a television producer that has solid growth potential over the next few years so I am just as focused on my Salary as I am for my market returns. That being said, do you think index investing is more beneficial for people that want to grow in the market but are happy with 8-10 percent as opposed to trying to find companies that can provide bigger gains? 

Can I get some opinions on FXAIX???

**Learning Tools:**

investing,"I have been interested in investing for a long time now, and only recently have I started looking at Reddit semi-frequently for advice. Long story short, I have noticed some trends and have some thoughts. I am ultimately hoping that more experienced players in the market will corroborate my thoughts or correct them.

I have noticed on this subreddit, r/pennystocks and, of course, r/wallstreetbets some interesting, and perhaps disturbing, trends. The most potent of which I believe to be a phenomenon where people are trying to outsmart (perhaps this isn't the right word) the market. As I understand it, and I could be wrong, a stock's value is somewhat a reflection of the aggregate of all human knowledge about that company. All information about that company, at some level, is already factored into the price of the stock. But, I often see investors trying to Macgyver information and trends into proof that a stock is 'going to go to the moon'. A lot of times I follow the stocks people boast about in the short and medium term, and let's just say a good amount of them are headed in the wrong direction. It is almost to the point where it is random chance whether they are right or not.

My point is not that there aren't some very talented investors here, there are. My point is that trying to discern between good investment advice and essentially gamblers hyping each other up is often hard to do, especially as a beginner.  It seems to me, that companies that are fundamentally sound do good on your investments (obvious I know). Trying to read into the crystal ball whether stocks that have lost more than half their value, like RCL, are going to bounce back or not, isn't useful. How could anyone know that information? At best it is speculation, but I honestly see it as guessing with extra steps. To me that is not real investing. 

Maybe I am wrong, but when I put my first thousand dollars into stocks today, I invested in MSFT and AWK. They both have been financially sound for years and continue to rise. There was no dip to buy in to or some extra knowledge I had on these companies that made me believe in them. It was the fact that their businesses were solid. There are a lot of people on this subreddit, and the others mentioned, that invest using sound technical analysis, but there a vast number of people here that seem to always try and find some secret sauce to double their investment in six months. A lot of those people get the most upvotes and the most attention. It makes it hard for people like me to tell what is good advice and what is not.

The reason I am writing all this is because I believe I may be wrong, and am very likely being arrogant and unkowledgeable. Please let me know. I want to get better, but a lot of what I see are people losing money for sport. I don't want to be a gambler, but it's hard to tell who is gambling and who is not.

investing,"I'm trying to push through this industry's annual reports because I work in shipping and we ship a lot of this stuff and because I think these companies don't get talked about a lot. They tend to be small cap companies or smaller (TPR, CPRI, MOV, etc) so naturally they wouldn't receive a lot of analyst attention. 

Bullish: High margin goods that tend to have a brand name and reputation to protect. It's not the easiest thing for someone to create a brand name and accompanying social clout as building that intangible asset takes decades. These companies tend to already have that. The lion's share of luxury goods companies cater to various price points so that they can capture market share (MOV makes watches ranging from $75-$10K, Capri Holdings owns brands covering accessory goods that sell within the $50-$4K range as well). All of them tend to be tied together to one another's success in some way. For example Movado is the exclusive licensee of Tommy Hilfiger watches so if PVH can continue to grow the value of that brand name then their relationship stays valuable for Movado's revenue stream as their exclusive watchmaker. Luxottica is also the licensee for some of Capri Holdings's accessory watches. There's an incredible amount of consolidation within this industry that I see happening within the next ten years. Tapestry is sorting through their Stuart Weitzman acquisition, PVH bought Arvind in Ethiopia (an emerging market) and the Geoffrey Beane name, Capri Holdings bought Versace very recently, and also LVMH buying out Tiffany's for an all cash deal (the firepower is there in the industry for big acquisitions and mergers).

Bearish: Loss in brand name value and reputation due to market share going towards private brands (Gucci, Yeezys are also growing in value something fierce, etc). I'm inclined to say COVID also because leather, the main product of luxury goods companies, is an animal product and animals can apparently catch COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Japanese tech giant SoftBank announced the $108 billion Vision Fund 2 last July.** 
* **The idea is that it would compliment the first $100 billion Vision Fund, which was announced in 2017.** 
* **Vision  Fund 1 reported huge losses on Monday after SoftBank wrote down the  valuations of companies like Uber and WeWork by billions.** 

**Summarized**

The  future of SoftBank's second Vision Fund is in jeopardy after the first  one reported record losses of $18 billion on Monday - thanks in large  part to the collapsing valuations of firms like Uber and WeWork, which  SoftBank has pumped billions into.

In  July 2019, SoftBank shocked tech investors again when it announced  plans to create a $108 billion ""Vision Fund 2"" to invest in artificial  intelligence.

The SoftBank Group  pledged to commit $38 billion to Vision Fund 2, while Apple, Microsoft  and Foxconn were all touted as external contributors that would commit  the extra billions.

Vision Fund 2 is up and running but only with the $38 billion from the SoftBank Group.

""The  performance of Vision Fund 1 is not that great, therefore we decided  not to do the marketing for Vision Fund 2 for the partners for a while,""  Son said on an earnings call earlier this week.

The  Vision Fund reported annual losses of $17.7 billion on Monday for the  year leading up to March 31, while the SoftBank Group reported annual  losses of $13 billion.

Cold feet  The Abu Dhabi state investment company, Mubadala, contributed to the  first Vision Fund but it is yet to confirm whether it plans to back the  second fund.

UBER announced a massive retrenchment and strategy diminution, with severe losses forcing it to let go of 25% of its work force.

UBER may shrink to simply a taxi-hail and food delivery app, as it abandons much of its future growth opportunities, jettisoning artificial intelligence, flying cars, self-driving cars, freight, and job-matching.

UBER’s core taxi business was down more than 80% in April, and both UBER and its clients' behavior indicates its not coming back to previous levels for years.

Others drawing from the same customer base face valuation collapses of more than 50%, while UBER is wrongly perceived to be a massive beneficiary of the COVID-19 induced economic collapse.

UBER’s stock continues to surge to highs of the year, more valuable than the entire airline industry, with marginal buyers ignoring the collapse of UBER’s core business.

First, we start with the massive secular change we are witnessing in the American workplace. Then, we move on to the lengthy and even semi-permanent changes to restaurants and travel.

We are witnessing a generational acceleration in work-from-home, in which commuting to and from work is facing the biggest and fastest change in its history. Companies such as Google, Square, and Twitter are preparing for a future in which employees may work remotely – forever. Others such as Facebook, JP Morgan, Citibank.  First, Twitter. This one is permanent:


Next, we have Square, also offering permanence:


Now, we turn to Facebook, who for now, is only planning until the end of the year:

Now we will shift to the banks, which are not only continuing work from home, but also seeking semi-permanent shifts away from urban centers, another hit to UBER's business. Citi is but one example; the list goes on and on, and is only growing by the days.

News and Thesis Update

UBER’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once sold UBER as the next Amazon, promising that “cars are to us what books are to Amazon.” Link here. Khosrowshahi, who was Barry Diller’s top salesman for a decade, pitched the taxi-hailing app, repackaged as “rideshare”, as simply the first step on a journey to global domination. UBER would enter and dominate “food delivery, freight, autonomous vehicles, and even buses and bikes”. Later, he added flying cars. By 2023, Khosrowshahi continued, UBER could run the entire transportation network for a city! As recently as UBER's latest 10-K, filed in February, UBER characterized its Freight business as ""revolutionizing"" the freight industry. And now they are simply going to shut it down? None of these promises have ever happened, of course, and with this week's forced retrenchment, likely never will.

Severe and unsustainable cash losses have forced UBER to ratchet back its strategic ambitions; to raise another $1.0BN of junk bonds at a steep 7.5%, and reduce on-the-books headcount by at least 25%. UBER will likely cut its ""non-core"" businesses, including freight, autonomous vehicles, flying cars, artificial intelligence, and job matching. These businesses, together, were the secret sauce that was to turn a simple and old-fashioned taxi-hailing app into the next big thing, rivaling Amazon in the scope and reach of its operations. These promises were what drew investors as big as Texas Pacific Group and Softbank in at valuations north of $70BN and even promised to approach $100BN - for a business that, in the here and now, is only able to generate revenues of $14BN, with growth slowing sharply, while margins remain massively negative, and billions of cash losses pile up - and that best case was pre-COVID!

Now, UBER faces a sharply diminished TAM, or total addressable market, as it gives up its ambitions to expand beyond taxi-hailing and food delivery, and major American and international corporations in various industries, including technology, media, real estate, airlines, hotels, and entertainment destinations all prepare us for a world of sharply diminished transportation needs. Where workers will shift to permanently working from home; where international travel will be diminished for years; where even domestic destination travel will face diminished capacity and utilization.

None of this has yet sunk into the minds of equity market investors.

THESIS

Diminution of Total Addressable Market. Uber is likely abandoning its ambitions to be a leader and create a revenue generating business in nearly every area besides its core taxi-hail and food delivery business. These early-non-core businesses, while inchoate and pre-revenue, gave investors hope that UBER was not just an old-fashioned transportation company making use of the latest technology - smartphone apps - but an actual technology company, with the same opportunity for horizontal expansion as Amazon. This hope was among the reasons why a negative cash burn of several billion dollars for a seemingly mundane business could turn into a $59 BN valuation. That hope is gone.

For its remaining core business, taxi-hail, the world has changed:

Negative Secular Changes to UBER’s Core Business

First, we start with the massive secular change we are witnessing in the American workplace. Then, we move on to the lengthy and even semi-permanent changes to restaurants and travel.

We are witnessing a generational acceleration in work-from-home, in which commuting to and from work is facing the biggest and fastest change in its history. Companies such as Google, Square, and Twitter are preparing for a future in which employees may work remotely – forever. Others such as Facebook, JP Morgan, Citibank, American Express and Microsoft have taken steps in this direction. Employees who commuted to these workplace jobs were often customers of UBER. Many of these customers and their ""rideshare"" business won’t come back. Here is a sampling of recent headlines that will negatively impact UBER - for at least several quarters in some cases, permanently in others:

First, Twitter. This one is permanent:

Now, we turn to Facebook, who for now, is only planning until the end of the year:

Next, we have buy in to work from home from the media, who indicate that working from home is the right thing to do:

￼

And the NY Times weighs in on the nascent trend:

￼

￼

￼

We also have consultancies now adding their voices to the chorus of work from home:

Surveys also indicate there is a new and growing movement for work-from-home accommodations. Global Workplace Analytics, a leading authority on integrated work at home strategies, recently published a report in which they forecast that as much as 25-30% of the workforce will be working from home by the end of 2021. See the full report here:

Work-at-Home After Covid-19-Our Forecast - Global Workplace Analytics

These are the thought leaders. We are witnessing a tsunami of potentially permanently lost taxi-hail business for these former commuters. While some of the headlines may say only through 2020, these arrangements are likely to be made permanent in many cases.

And now, the rest of the ride-share customer universe: the restaurant, travel and leisure industry have been decimated, with full year 2020 volumes estimated to be down anywhere from nearly 20% (fast food) to 40% (hotels) to more than 50% (airlines and certain destination-based entertainment.)

Obviously, none of these industries by themselves comprise UBER's exact customer base, but taken collectively, they are representative of what has happened to the total addressable market: it is severely impaired.

Selected Peer Group Performance 2020

Throughout the latest strategy retreat, 25% work force reduction, revenue collapse, junk debt capital raise, and multi-billion dollar cash burn, one thing stands out: UBER’s high flying stock, which has surged this week along with the NASDAQ market to a new high for the year of $59 billion, now up 16% on the year. Stated another way, stock buyers have treated COVID-19 and its catastrophic impact on UBER’s revenues and margins as a net positive catalyst. This stands in stark contrast to the many other companies operating in and round UBER’s universe, including hotels, airlines, lodging, office space, and even other “unicorns"".

We highlight the 2020 changes in valuation of numerous companies that derive revenues from similar underlying strategic drivers as UBER: commuting to work, commuting to airports, commuting to leisure activities, commuting to restaurants and bars, and commuting to vacation. We lay out the year to date equity returns, followed by consensus changes to 2020 forecast revenues. Every data point indicates UBER’s valuation change is completely inconsistent with its related peer group.

First, we frame UBER’s equity valuation change year to date, along with the consensus expectation for 2020 Revenues, and list how they have changed, showing the January 1, 2020 consensus estimate, followed by the current 2020 consensus estimate.

As you can see, UBER is up 16% year to date, while its 2020E Revenue expectations have been reduced by 29%.

￼

Then, we turn to the various comparably impacted industries, as described above. We start with Airlines, as airports are a primary source and destination of UBER customers, and note the average hit to airline valuation has been 66%, while the average expected hit to revenues in 2020 has been 56%.

￼

Next, we look at Hotels, a common destination and origin for UBER customers, where you can see the average hotel has taken a 39% valuation hit, while the expected revenue decline is 40%.

￼

Office REITS, which we also use as a proxy of demand for commuting to work, have seen an average 42% decline in valuation, with only a 5% hit to revenues. Here, the financial forecasts are out of sync with the change in valuation. Even the out years look similar. Expect the numbers to come down, significantly.

￼

Restaurants are a large and fractured group, and we chose McDonalds as simply a directional indicator:

￼

And finally, the still-private “unicorns”, who bear much structural similarity to UBER, particularly AirBnB which also was forced to fire 25% of its work force, and to reduce its strategic scope to “core” operations while giving up on growth opportunities. Here, you will see that AirBnB recently took a 52.6% hit to its private market valuation since 2019, and WeWork took a 60% hit to its December 2019 valuation (which was itself an 84% hit to its January 2019 valuation). AirBnB’s CEO also wrote a letter that sounds nearly identical to UBER’s CEO “I’m-sorry-but-you’re-fired, our business is collapsing” letter.

￼

The overall context should be clear: UBER's entire ecosystem has experienced a volume and valuation collapse compared to UBER's year to date double digit stock price growth. This stock price growth is inconsistent with the underlying data.

We specifically concede that none of these companies are perfect comparables, but all derive revenues from a similar ecosystem: the home-work-travel-leisure nexus, and their customers must be transported somehow to their offices, their hotels, their airports, and their leisure AirBnB vacations. Together, they paint a picture: UBER’s equity price has largely ignored the reality of a collapsed ecosystem, and is the only related equity that not only has not collapsed, but is actually UP double digits on the year.

Will UBER’s business come back? Absolutely, some of it will come back. The travel/airline/hotel transport nexus actually has the highest probability of coming back, but the longest lead time. These won’t see even a near-full recovery for several years, in line with forecasts for hotel and airlines revenue. The most at risk revenue is actually related to work commuting: many employers are in the process of shifting to permanent work-from-home arrangements. UBER will never recover this revenue. Much of the work commute revenue IS NEVER COMING BACK. Thus, UBER's TAM has shrunk.","Workplace commuters were often customers of UBER. Many of these customers and their ""rideshare"" business won’t come back, as companies instituted forever WFH policy. As much as 25-30% of the workforce will be working from home by the end of 2021."

What is CRISPR, how does it work, who does what?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY) (**How does it work**)

Basically every living organism is comprised of a DNA code that determines it's layout based on 4 'letters' (amino acids ATCG). **CRISPR related tech allows you to change, alter or delete certain parts of that code with relative ease**. Hopefully you can imagine the consequences of this little fact, being able to be an architect of life itself. If you can't don't worry others have already done it for you. A few years ago a huge battle has broken out about who owns and invented the tech, to this day.

On one side you have Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes, which is now considered one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology. They are from the University of California and Vienna, which in their turn have their own subsidiaries Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and CRISPR therapeutics (CRSP). And on the other side you have Feng Zhang with the Broad insitute of MIT and Harvard and their subsidiaries Editas Medicine (EDIT).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/EditasMedicine/comments/eqzjmx/crispr\_patent\_landscape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EditasMedicine/comments/eqzjmx/crispr_patent_landscape/)

The patent battle is very complicated to say the least, because the tech itself is constantly evolving (ex. Base editing by Beam Therapeutics). Also legally there is a difference between using CRISPR in eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells. But it won't be the same in every country. So at the moment you have four public traded companies who are utilizing CRISPR tech for human therapeutic uses:

investing,"Warren Buffet was born to a well connected family. His father was a senator. His first stock purchase was when he was a kid, his father brought him to NY stock exchange, by chairman of Goldman Sachs.

As a well connected person, he had access to lots of info retail investors had limited access to. He could analyse a company all day, reading its financial statements and so on. Very few people back then could do that. 

With the advance of internet all changed. Nowadays financial reports and other public info are read in miliseconds by comptuers, and by experts and pros the first day its published. Buffet lost his edge.

That's why Buffet lagged behind SPY in the recent decades. He was never a true legend, merely a privilleged player, taking advantage of public info that was hard to come by back in the old days. Worshipping Buffet is akin to worshipping a wallhacker in FPS games. 

And by the way, Buffet supposely has investment horizon of at least 5 years. How many 5 years you got in your life? Want to be a millionaire when you're old and senile and no longer can even get it up? What's to even enjoy with that?

investing,"I cashed out about 40% of my positions a month ago. I bought a bunch of stocks I liked long-term at current valuations near bottom and my portfolio had made it back to pre-COVID breakeven, but I got spooked by economist warnings of an actual depression, the billionaire investors sitting on the largest cash position in history, the tech stocks hitting ATHs in the middle of a dead underlying economy, bankruptcies starting and epidemiologist warning of major disaster if we reopen too soon. Earning season would be a bloodbath and unemployment hitting record levels since the Great Depression. There's never been a pure v-shaped recovery, so why would this be the first one?

""You can't time the market (as in sell at the peak and buy at the bottom), but you can be rationally optimistic or pessimistic about the overall direction and act accordingly"" I thought. ""I'm going to take profits from this irrational FOMO bubble and keep some money on the sidelines so I can snatch up long-term stocks for well below current valuations when this whole thing inevitably collapses."" Moreover, I didn't want to see my portfolio back down 30% again if could avoid it.

Welp, most the stocks I sold are up \~20% since then. I still hold positions in all of them, but missed out on thousands and thousands of gains. 

The reason you ""can't time the market"" is that market is not rational.  The market goes up on bad news and down on good news. Stock valuations have nothing to do with actual values, the underlying economy, etc - only whether investors perceive future growth.  People want to get into positions in good companies as quickly as possible,  and thus it becomes a FOMO race all the way back up or above where you started, like an eBay auction where competition drives a price above where you might have sold had you simply offered a flat price. 

Rational economic pessimism has been a disaster ever since the economic reforms in 2009. The Fed is always going to work against any bets against the economy (well, unless you are investing in Berkshire or banks during a crisis, apparently...They're lending money at no interest and bailing out failing companies, leaving no room for such opportunists to profit.) Thus they've detached Wall Street from the underlying economy almost completely.

And you know the second you spend every penny going long on everything, the whole house of cards will finally collapse and you'll be holding underwater stocks at extremely high valuations or with extreme risk of a prolonged shutdown. Because that's what you deserve for being so irrational.","How I finally learned ""You can't time the market"""

Elementary question here but want to get some advice. 

I have a Chase YouInvest account I’m looking to streamline into mostly Vanguard ETFs. 

I’m in a taxable account holding mostly fidelity mutual funds. I would like to get rid of them because the expense rate is higher than ETFs. 

My main concerns: 
FSPTX (would like to switch to VGT or QQQ). 

Fidelity medical sector mutual fund (would like to just dump this money into VGT or FXAIX). 

What’s the best way to handle the capital gains from FSPTX and the Med Fund? 

1. Is there any in kind swap from fidelity to ETFs? 

2. Should I create a second tech position and just leave the FSPTX position as is. 

3. Eat the gains ? 

4. Is there something I don’t see ?",Streamlining Account
investing,"I just tried posting this in r/cryptocurrency but the mods deleted it instantly. I am honestly just curious and looking for an answer. Not shilling cryptocurrency, I just don't know how this would be taxed

If you own a company involved in different types of business, and you convert your payments(which would be income tax taxable) for that business into cryptocurrency, do you pay taxes on the original USD value of the payments(that would be considered profit), or the value of the crypto at the end of the fiscal year, or the value of the cryptocurrency when/if you sell it for USD?

For example, if you made $500k in a company bank account, hypothetically you’d owe whatever percent in taxes and have to set that aside. If you made that money, and put that into cryptocurrency under the same companies ownership, if the prices go up I understand you’d have to pay capital gain tax, if the prices went down for a specific year, would you have to pay the full income tax on the original $500k profit, or, let’s say it devalued to $250k, would you just have to pay taxes on $250k of income, or would you still have had to set aside the equivalent income tax for the $500k USD you originally earned?

I am asking, because if I didn’t have to pay the taxes for the for the initial value in case of a decrease, I am considering basically going all-in for my company’s funds(btw, I am the sole owner and employee of my LLC, so it’s not like I am risking the money for any other people besides myself).

If I just paid my self the $500,000 USD from the business account to my personal account, I’d have to set aside damn near 40% for income taxes before I could reinvest any. But if I use the full $500k and buy crypto in the company name, I’d still have to pay income tax if/when I’d cash out and pay myself outside of the companies finances, but I would be better protected incase the value of the cryptocurrency dropped. For example, if I kept it in the company name, put the full $500k in crypto, and the crypto prices went down and the total value of the crypto went to $100k that year(and I didn’t sell), but still had to pay taxes for $500k income instead of $100k income(what my business’s income would have ended up being in that scenario) then I’d be short on tax money and out of luck.

I’m not asking if it’s a good or bad idea, I am just wondering what the taxes would be in the case of a decrease in value rather than an increase in value.

As you can see, if this is legal and fine, this would be advantageous to me in worst case scenario. If I take out $500,000 from my business to pay myself my own salary, and then I buy crypto, I am sure I'd have to pay the income tax on that $500k payment no matter what, and would have to set aside the equivalent USD. However, I figure if the purchase of crypto through the the business entity, and keep it in the business entity, I might only be taxed on the outcome of the investment if sold, or current value at the end of the fiscal year?

I'm not trying to evade taxes. Ideally I'd like to double that $500k, and then pay taxes on $1m instead of $500k of income. I just want to make sure I don't have crazy IRS debt if I put my entire business account into cryptocurrency and the markets tanked(I think highly unlikely this year, but let's say hypothetically, maybe a different year)",Question about using business finances for cryptocurreny

Hong Kong stocks tumble on Chinese national security announcement

Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong

Hong Kong stocks tumbled on Friday after the Chinese government said it planned to impose national security legislation on the city as simmering geopolitical tensions add to concerns for investors already rattled by the coronavirus pandemic.

In early trading, the city’s Hang Seng index fell 2.8 per cent amid rising fears that the show of legal force could reignite mass protests in the Asian financial hub and worsen tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have intensified after US accusations that China was responsible for the pandemic. China’s CSI 300 stock index slipped 0.8 per cent.

The official agenda of China’s National People’s Congress, released on Thursday, included a proposal to “improve” national security protections in Hong Kong but did not give details of the planned changes.

The falls followed Wall Street’s decline overnight as President Donald Trump claimed China was behind a disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe. The S&amp;P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent and the technology-dominated Nasdaq was 1.0 per cent lower.

China drops GDP target for first time in history

Don Weinland in Beijing

China’s National People’s Congress has not set a gross domestic product target for the first time as the country faces its most severe economic downturn since the 1970s in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The growth target has in the past been included in the work report presented at the political event, which was delayed by almost three months this year due to the outbreak. The work report this year does not contain the target.

While many experts do not trust China’s reported economic figures, the target often provides guidance on the central government’s confidence in underlying economic conditions.

investing," **Summary:** Kura Oncology (NASDAQ: KURA) is a $800M market cap biotech developing targeted oncology drugs. The company IPO’ed in 2015 and is led by a highly-respected group of scientists and researchers with a strong track record of successfully developing and commercializing precision oncology medicines. Kura’s primary asset, tipifarnib, has shown impressive data that could help it become the first drug approved for the treatment of HRAS-mutated cancers, providing a line of sight to $500M in peak sales over time. We believe this would support a valuation of $20-25/share over the next year (vs. $16/share today) without even accounting for value from Kura’s earlier stage pipeline. 

**Key Takeaways**

* Kura is currently enrolling its registrational AIM-HN trial that could read out as early as October 2020, and based on tipifarnib’s Phase 2 data, we believe that there is a **strong likelihood of a successful readout**. Kura is developing tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, for HRAS-mutated cancers, starting with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 
* Tipifarnib could achieve **\~$500M in peak sales** in HRASm HNSCC alone, with the opportunity to expand into larger HRAS indications as well as earlier lines of treatment through combination therapies. 
* Using a peak sales multiple of 2.5-3x and POS of 75% for tipifarnib, we arrive at a **probability-adjusted value of $20-25/share** based on tipifarnib alone. When factoring in the additional upside potential of the early stage pipeline, we believe that Kura offers an attractive risk-reward from \~$16/share today. We will be initiating a position in Kura, targeting a 6% weight. 

**Key Stock Drivers**

* **Unique asset with scientifically-sound mechanism of action.** HRAS is a gene that, when mutated, produces a defective HRas protein that activates a signaling cascade that has been identified as a central contributor to tumor growth and proliferation. The HRas protein can only activate its signaling pathway by binding to the cell membrane through a process called farnesylation (basically adding a special protein group to HRas). Tipifarnib, Kura’s drug, is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that prevents the farnesylation process and thus prevents HRas signaling. While this may sound simple, Kura is currently the only company in the clinic with an FTI and could be the first to market with a drug for HRAS-mutant cancers. 
* **Initial patient population with high unmet need.** HNSCC is the 6th largest cancer indication worldwide, with 60,000 new patients in the US annually. Of these cases, 5-8% (\~3,000 patients) have an HRAS mutation. The prognosis for these patients using standard immunotherapy and chemo is extremely poor, with an average 15-35% objective response rate (ORR) and 3 months progression free survival (PFS) across 1st and 2nd line therapy. 
* **De-risked Phase 2 data.** Tipifarnib has already demonstrated strong activity in HRASm HNSCC; in its Phase 2 trial, tipifarnib achieved an ORR of 56% (10/18) and a clinical benefit rate of 100% in advanced recurrent/metastatic HRASm HNSCC patients, and a median PFS of 6.1 months. Given the already poor outcomes of HRASm patients, we believe that the bar for approval is low, with 25% ORR and 6 months PFS being sufficient for approval, which compares favorably to what tipifarnib has already achieved. 
* **$500M Peak Sales Potential.** At peak, assuming 3,000 HRASm HNSCC patients, 50% penetration, average treatment duration of 1 year + 10,000 additional HRAS-eligibile patients, 10% penetration (conservative), and 6 months average treatment duration, and an annual price of $250,000, we arrive at $500M in potential peak sales for tipifarnib in HRAS-mutant cancers. 
* **Experienced, accomplished leadership team.** Kura’s management team boasts stellar track records in drug development and commercialization, achieved over decades of industry experience. CEO Troy Wilson previously led Wellspring Biosciences, a notable private, targeted oncology biotech, as well as Intellikine, which was acquired by Takeda. CCO Kirsten Flowers led the successful launches of Brafktovi/Mektovi at Array Biopharma prior to its $11B acquisition by Pfizer. Other team members boast similarly impressive resumes from their time at companies including Merck and Pfizer, where they held senior leadership positions.  
* **Optionality from early stage pipeline.** Besides HNSCC, tipifarnib is also being evaluated in additional squamous cell carcinomas,  peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), where it is currently in Phase 2 trials. These opportunities could represent up to 10,000 additional patients eligible for tipifarnib. Kura is also developing KO-539, a menin-MLL inhibitor, for certain types of leukemia, starting with AML. 
* **Upcoming catalysts in 2020/21.** Kura has clear upcoming milestones that we expect will have a large impact on the stock:

1. ***Late 2020/early 2021.*** Potential readout of registrational AIM-HN trial evaluating tipifranib in HRAS-mutant HNSCC. 
2. ***Mid-2020.*** Data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial evaluating tipifarnib in CMML. 
3. ***Year-end 2020.*** Readout of Phase 1 trial evaluating KO-539 in AML and achievement of a recommended Phase 2 dose. 

* **Cash to fund operations into 2022.** Kura ended 1Q20 with $350M in pro-forma cash (includes proceeds from equity issuance in May 2020), which the company expects will fund operations comfortably into 2022. This should provide Kura with ample time to fully enroll the AIM-HN trial barring any extreme delays and support the rest of its clinical programs.
* **Strong IP estate.** Kura has multiple patents that provide tipifarnib exclusivity in HRASm HNSCC until 2036, while protecting other IP including the mechanism of action, use in combination therapy, and dosing/scheduling, etc. 

**Key Stock Risks**

* **Clinical and regulatory failure.** Like most biotechs, Kura’s value would be significantly impaired if tipifarnib were to show worse-than-expected clinical results or severe safety issues. Regulators could also set a higher bar for approval than we are projecting. 
* **Delay of trial timelines.** The biggest near-term risk to Kura is the possibility that the enrollment of the AIM-HN trial is delayed meaningfully past the late 2020/early 2021 target management has guided to. While this would only delay tipifarnib’s data readout, we would expect any material slippage in the trial timeline to have an adverse effect on the stock. 
* **Lower-than-expected HRAS sequencing.** Identifying patients with HRAS-mutant cancers is critical to tipifarnib’s commercial potential. While Kura is working to establish HRAS genetic screening as standard practice, this may be difficult in indications where HRAS mutations are rare (such as HNSCC) and thus limit tipifarnib sales.

Moving the stocks from Robinhood to TDA was a breeze. I spoke with an agent on the phone and he promised me to refund if Roinhood charge any transfer fee (I think $75). But I never got that transfer fee, reason I think I left about $2k worth of my crypto and only transferred the other stocks (you have this option at TDA to specify which stocks to transfer, don't use the option to move everything and close the account). Before this move, I already started trading at TDA so I left the stocks at Robinhood alone till things transferred to TDA. It took about a week for the whole thing to transfer. After few months, I closed the crypto positions and move the money back to bank. I still have some left over money &lt;$100 at Robinhood and I still like to use their simple UI to track some stocks etc.  

I'm still a beginner and still learning stuff, but I really like the fact that TDA gives you much bigger margin to start with. I think at Robinhood its like just $1k without Gold. I think even with Gold its something like $2k based on the tire you are in. Here at TDA, I straightaway gets about twice the stocks of buying power something like for $25k, I get $50k buying power. Also when I start day trading I get about 4 times the buying power (closer to $100k). I rarely use the margin and I think the max I used was about $3k-$4k last few times. For beginners, I believe you should be careful with how you handle the margin.  I'd always go with the cash at hand than the margin. 

I hope this helps and happy to answer if you have any questions.",Moved from Robinhood to TD Ameritrade and Just Got Break-even after 2. 5 years trading

investing,"The stock market is forward looking and while a lot of major companies have acquired the capital to survive the pandemic, they have done it mainly through debt at the cost of their balance sheet's health. The short term erosion of the market is going to make it such that a larger percentage of a company's earnings are going to be used to pay off the interest of the debt that they had to secure to stay afloat (higher interest rates and lower EBIT). While people's hope that we will return to real life soon, consumer spending will be delayed until there is confidence that the market is stabilized and unemployment shrinks back to the single digits.

In the US, Q1 earnings only included about a month of lockdown measures and most companies recorded impairments totaling in the billions of dollars nationwide. An impairment in the simplest sense is the reflection that a company paid more money for an asset than they will get value out of it, thus reflecting poor investment in earnings producing assets. Looking forward to Q2, I expect an even greater negative impact from COVID-19 since we are still under governmental restrictions nearing the end of May which, I believe, will extend through June if not further. This contraction will be reflected in company earnings and the GDP of the nation. For Q1 2020 the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that GDP shrank by -4.8%, compared to Q4 2019, driven by a 7.6% decrease in personal consumption and a 5.6% decrease in gross private domestic investment, partially offset by an increase of 0.7% by government consumption. Compared to Q1 2019 the private investment and personal spending decreased 11.9 and 8.7 percentage points, respectively. Looking forward, consumer spending and private domestic investment is expected to decrease further due to even lower consumer spending and private domestic investment and will be offset by higher Gevernmental spending.

The YTD rolling average PE ratio for the S&amp;P 500 (which is fairly tech heavy) has decreased by about 10%. PE ratio, for those who don't know, is calculated as the price of a Company's stock divided by their earnings per share and reflects the investor's belief in future growth. The 4 quarter rolling EPS number (the denominator) for most companies shrank due to poor performance in Q1 which would cause the PE ratio to go up but since the PE ratio went down. It didn't, meaning the stock prices have dropped by about 10% more than the EPS. The problem, however, is that EPS only includes 1 quarter of poor performance and 3 quarters of 2019's incredibly strong EPS. The coming quarters are expected (if not known) to have weaker EPS due to COVID-19, and therefore we should see a significant spike the PE ratio. When the PE ratio goes up, I then expect stock prices to decrease proportionally and normalize the ratio.

Company's took on debt and furloughed workers which limits earnings growth in the near and mid-term future, Q1 2020 private investment decreased 11.9 percentage points and consumer spending decreased 8.7 percentage points compared to Q1 2019, GDP decreased by 4.8% compared to Q4 2019 and is expected to decrease further due to a full quarter of state mandated restrictions, and the average PE ratio decreased by 9.8% but does not fully reflect expected EPS decreases in the coming quarter(s). This means that we should expect the stock prices are trading at a higher level than the market would suggest and should be expected to contract.

This is all just my opinion based on the data and would love to hear your opinions. Thanks for reading.",Have we transitioned to a bull market?

I'll try to quote some relevant sections from the NYT article:

&gt; “I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.  Mr. Bloom, a co-author of an analysis of the coronavirus epidemic’s effects on the labor market, estimates that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.

&gt; “Firms intend to hire these people back,” Mr. Bloom said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “But we know from the past that these aspirations often don’t turn out to be true.”

&gt;In this case, the economy that comes back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.  Large companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will, in turn, reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.

investing,"By Sally Bakewell and Sridhar Natarajan

(Bloomberg) -- The struggles of a U.S. electronics recycler looking for a $10 million lifeline is exposing a weakness in the $700 billion market for collateralized loan obligations. 4L Holdings Corp. is seeking a cash infusion that would help it outlast the economic pain the coronavirus outbreak has had on its business. That’s sparking the ire of CLO managers who could see their stakes in the firm wiped away, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The issue has spiraled into a legal brawl. On one side are a handful of CLO shops, which because of structural limitations, are prevented from pumping more money into the company. On the other are private equity firm Vector Capital and hedge fund Diameter Capital Partners, which would help provide the cash in exchange for 85% of 4L’s equity.

The dispute may be a sign of things to come. Amid predictions of a surge in bankruptcies, CLOs increasingly risk their debt holdings being converted into equity stakes in troubled companies that need more capital. But the vehicles aren’t typically able to provide new equity injections. They’re limited from doing that to prevent CLO managers from being tempted to chase risky investments. That’s creating opportunities for other investors to fill the void, diluting the stakes held by CLOs.

“It’s like watching a game of Pac-Man,” said Vincent Indelicato, a partner at law firm Proskauer Rose LLP. “These transactions have allowed non-CLO lenders to gobble up an outsized share of the reorganized company that otherwise would have been allocated pro rata to the CLOs.” Representatives for 4L, Vector and Diameter declined to comment.


The current situation has similarities to when Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy last
year. Its lenders, also CLOs, were prevented from fronting the company much-needed cash because of restrictions on how much CCC rated debt they could hold.

In the 4L case, the company had already filed for bankruptcy after reaching a deal with its creditors to cut its roughly $644 million debt load. Under the plan, lenders would swap all but $80 million of the company’s remaining term loans into 100% of the equity in the reorganized entity after owner Golden Gate Capital ceded control.

The restructuring capped one of the biggest collapses last year in the $1.2 trillion market for leveraged loans. The value of 4L’s term loan had plunged into distressed levels in July after the company told lenders it lost two key customers and had hired advisers to study its options.

The proposal by Vector and Diameter to invest in additional equity would shut out the CLOs unless some other part of their firm is willing to front that capital per the terms, the people said. The CLO managers argue this deal could have been structured differently so that they could participate. 4L’s lenders have hired Sidley Austin to oppose the deal, while the electronics recycler has hired Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, the people said.",A Weakness in Giant CLO Market Exposed in Tiny Stock Deal

I have always had the intentions of being a long term investor and have been accumulating shares since late last year. Typically I have bought into companies with products I have faith in, nothing major in terms of research outside of reading quarterly reports.

I Trully dont understand who is making Marketing for GOLD but they are probably n1 PR company in the whole world. Every where you step in the world, gold is viewed as the ultimate investment that is backed by an actuall piece of a valuable thing and THAT is going to last forever.

And you are met with the slimiest companies , shady practices, markups and fees that will kill your investment to death especially if we are talking under 10k invesmtnets. And the damn thing barely moves or beats inflation. 
Not to mention if you actually want to have it in your hands its so much hussle and risk of theft or another money to insure or put it into bank safe. Not worth it and not to mention huge part of gold that is traded isnt even real and you cannot do anything with it, buy or pay online, you have to sell it for $ again with another cut to some company. I get it what GOLD is and I get why people value or like it but its not really that great and is quickly losing peoples faith in it. Gold will crash one day because it will become so useless and so non-economical and from certain generation people will not care about gold at all. 

My whole point is that Its shocking how you never hear anything bad about gold or how you would have a hard time finding someone who isnt positive on gold as the most stable a safest bet. Yet when you mention bitcoin people will actually open up textbook with 10 pages of why bitcoin is terrible idea (and rightly so , not suggesting anything ).",Gold is such a snake oil.

investing,"Hundreds of thousands of self-employed and gig-economy workers are receiving unemployment benefits for the first time through a temporary coronavirus-related program, but those claims aren’t reflected in overall totals since the pandemic started more than two months ago.

The Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims report, due out Thursday, is expected to show that millions of workers filed claims again last week. Initial weekly claims have been declining since a peak of nearly seven million at the end of March, but have remained historically high.

The omission of self-employed workers means the actual number of people seeking claims has been higher since the federal program called pandemic unemployment assistance, included in a stimulus package approved in late March, got under way.


Arizona mailed out unemployment checks to 165,000 individuals early last week who were eligible for unemployment under the self-employed program.

New Jersey processed 135,000 such applications between April 26 and May 9. Officials expect that number to increase significantly over the next two weeks as they fine-tune their processing of these claims.

investing,"Hi all,

So during the lockdown I had some extra time and decided to finally read the book Warren Buffet considers ""The best book on investment ever written"". I was skeptical since I had read comments like ""It's old"", ""value investing is dead"", ""Even Buffet cannot beat the S&amp;P 500 in recent decade"" etc. I will not try to summarise the book but will mention my quick review in points:

1. Yes this book is OLD. But what feels old are the references the book uses to make its points. The fundamental principles the book is trying to teach seem as relevant as ever. 
2. This book is NOT for beginners. Please don't read this book if you are very new to investing. The book at many times throws terms and references which complete newbies will find trouble following. You will better enjoy the book if you already have a rough idea of some common investing terms. Also, if you are already into investment, you will be able to find the logical current analogue of the references that Graham makes.
3. The commentary by Jason Zweig is AWESOME. Be sure to pick the commentary version since it completely enhances the readability and relevance of the book. He shows, through more recent examples, as to how the principles Graham is talking about are still relevant.
4. This book is INTENSE. It will take a lot of time and energy to go through the book. It reads more like an intense course book than a typical non-fiction book. But I felt it was all worth it for the insights it gives you.
5. Try to understand the underlying message rather than focusing on the specific numbers or names being talked about. Of course, the exact value/method of Debt/Equity, PE etc. Graham talks about may feel outdated but the underlying principles seem as fresh as they were then.
6. Value Investing and Growth Investing can work together. The book never says anything inherently negative about ""growth stocks"". In fact it does mention that these ""growth stocks"" can be bought at reasonable prices. If you are familiar with some basic principles given by Peter Lynch in this regard, it would help a lot I think.

I'm relatively new to investing myself so only time will tell if I will be able to translate these learnings into actual returns. But I feel much more confident of making independent stock buying/selling decisions after reading this book. And for that alone, it was worth it.

investing,"With many countries experiencing economic contraction and decrease in GDP due to the COVID19 pandemic, the third largest economy Japan has entered recession for the first time since 2015. According to data reported on Monday, the economy shrank by an annualized rate of 3.4 percent this quarter followed by a 7.3 percent plunge in GDP in the last quarter of 2019.

# WHAT IS A RECESSION?

The economy is often said to have entered recession when there are two or more consecutive quarters of negative economic growth especially measured with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since the industrial revolution, many countries have experienced a growth trend in their economies. While this growth was a long-term growth, there have definitely been many short-term fluctuations and declines, like the one we are experiencing now with the pandemic are known as a recession.

# RECESSION OR DEPRESSION?

The global economy has definitely been impacted by this pandemic where many countries are experiencing contraction in their economic activities. The question we have to ask now is how long will it take for this recession to recover. Kristalina Georgiva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spoke on an interview with Reuters that “During the financial crisis ten years ago, part of the world managed to grow and pulled others up. Now, we all are in a situation of recession, almost with no exception, the growth is downwards” and predicted that the economy is unlikely to recover by 2021.

Some of the major economies are included in the 170 countries that Georgiva mentioned in the interview. Namely, the following economies are facing large contractions.

**United States** where Kevin Hassett, a former economic adviser at the White House, told CNBC that ""You're looking at something like minus 20% to minus 30% (GDP) in the second quarter.""

**Japan** where the Government announced its recession on Monday with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP.

**China** where it experienced negative GDP in decades.

**United Kingdom** where the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimated that the growth contraction will be approximately 25-30%.

With the current pandemic, it is very difficult to predict when the economy will be recovered. Will this recession lead to a depression? At the moment there are no mentions of this recession becoming a depression. On a side note, the global crisis due to subprime mortgage that occurred between 2007-2009 was ranked as the second worst recession of all time and was named the ""Great Recession"". If this pandemic doesn't trigger a global economic crisis that is worse than the GFC in 2008, it is unlikely to become a depression.

# HOW SHOULD WE PREPARE?

Apart from cutting overhead costs the best way to prepare would be to find a side hustle. Finding a way to supplement your income from home is probably the most feasible thing you could do at this moment in time. Investing is one of the most accessible source to insulate your income. However in an unstable economic environment, investing may sound counterintuitive when the stock market is falling and everyone is panicking.

A good way to leverage this situation would be to trade on derivatives exchanges where you can capitalize on both the uptrend and downfall of assets. In other words, you are able to generate profit in a falling market.

International stocks tend to alternate with USA stocks for superior returns, with the tables being tilted in one direction for 5-10 years at a time. International stocks have now been underperforming compared to US stocks for the past 10 years. The last time we had 10 years of US market superiority, it was 1990-2000, the big tech boom. Then from 2000-2008, international stocks beat the US market by 10%. Then the great recession in the USA, and then the bull run from 2009-2020. Then a huge market correction in 2020.

Beginning from mid February the total money supply (M1) was increased by 1 trillion (from 4 to 5 trillion) in total by now.

investing,"**TIPS AND NOMINAL BONDS**

So with a nominal bond ETF, the Weighted Avg Coupon is basically the yield, and the YTM is the expected return, meaning the yield +/- change in price. Let's use AGG as an example. The coupon is 3.36%, and the YTM is 1.40%. This means you will receive 3.36%, while the price declines by 1.96%, leaving you with a 1.4% return. To get real return, you need to take inflation out of the 1.4%. Assuming inflation is 2%, you will have a -0.4% real return.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm confused when it comes to TIPS ETFs. Let's use TIP as an example. It's YTM is 0.53%. But, of course, it's face value will be adjusted upwards with inflation. The result is that the YTM will actually be your return net of inflation, since inflation will not eat out of the YTM, since the face value will be adjusted accordingly. Is this correct? The thing that is really puzzling me is the 12m trailing yield. It is at 2.15%. How can it possibly be even close to that high? Its coupon is only at 0.69%. The trailing yield is what I don't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if I am right (and assuming a 2% inflation rate), a nominal bond ETF will give you a -0.4% real return, while TIPS will give you 0.53%. Is it a fair assessment to say that at the moment TIPS are better than nominal bonds? Also, is it fair to state that nominal bonds will give a negative return anytime their YTM is less than inflation? Also, is it fair to state that as long as TIPS YTM is greater then nominal bonds YTM - inflation, TIPS are better?

**BONDS VS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS**

Now, I live in Canada, so I'm not sure of the exact savings account rates available in the US. Here, you can get an easy 2% with online banks. Forget TIPS, this is just concerning nominal bonds vs saving accounts. If you can get 2% in a savings account, vs the 1.5% from bonds (Canadian bonds, but doesn't change the argument), would it not make sense to hold the bond portion of your portfolio in a savings account? If rates stay the same, you're better off, and if rates rise, you will be MUCH better off, because bonds will tank.

**DIFFERENCE US-LISTED AND CAD-LISTED BETWEEN ETF YIELDS**

I'm assuming this sub is mostly US-based, but there are probably some people that can help. I'm finding a large discrepancy between Canadian listed and us listed ETF yields, even though they track the same index, or even when the Canadian ETF literally holds the US ETF. I'm going to use IEMG and XEC for the example, though I found this between many pairs. XEF is CAD-listed, and it literally holds IEMG. Their performance should be virtually identical. The performance will differ due to being listed in different currencies, but the YIELD should be the same, right? If the currency actually affects the yield itself, then stop reading and let me know.

I'm going to compare both of their 12m trailing yields. Ishares calculates this by summing all income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV. I did the same [HERE!](https://imgur.com/a/nqw2mTy) I got the same number as iShares did for IEMG, being \~3.83%. For XEC, I got 3.26, while iShares says it is 2.56. This is a huge difference, even though I literally used the last 2 distributions listed on iShares website. Since XEF just holds IEMG, the distribution SHOULD be IEMG's distribution, minus 15% for foreign withholding tax. 3.83 - 15% = 3.3%, but its only 2.56%. Even in my own calculation, IEMG's yield - 15% = XEF's yield, since XEF distributes after the 15% is taken out. Does anyone know what to make of this? I found this to be the case across multiple ETF pairs.

I pulled daily data from Yahoo!Finance for DJIA from May 19, 1995 until May 19, 2020. I just picked 25 years, no particular reason. I then compared the daily open to the previous day's close as an estimate for what the futures market was like overnight. I then set a completely arbitrary limit of +0.33% and -0.33% change in the daily open vs. the previous day close. 

Out of 6,293 trading days, 259 met the +/- 0.33% criteria, with 251 coming on or after 6/20/2016. Did something change in June 2016 that made futures more volatile? 

Anyways, out of the 259, 147 had days with futures above or equal to 0.33%. Out of those, there were 110 (or 75%) where buying at the opening bell and selling at the closing bell would have made you money; on average, 0.92% per day. The other 37 days you would've lost money (not factoring in profit could be made with options), and averaged a loss of 0.80% per day. Over all of the 147 days, on average, you could make 0.48% profit per day buying at open and selling at close.

The remaining 112 days where the futures were down by at least 0.33%, 45 days (or 40%) you still could've made money by the method mentioned above. Once again, you still would've averaged 0.92% per day if money were to be made. The remaining 67 days you would lose an average of 1.12%. Over all the 112 days, on average, a daily loss of 0.41% would've been seen.

Granted, profits can be changed by selling during a higher point or lower point intraday, I didn't look at the daily highs and lows due to the fact it's hard to judge when those occur until after they've happened.

I do find it interesting that if someone follow this method, if the intraday price went up over 0.92%, they should sell. As I used the DJIA for my base, something like DIA could be used to mimic this potentially.

This analysis tells me if futures are up overnight by at least 0.33%, I should buy at the open and play the odds that I can make money by selling that day. If futures are down at least 0.33%, I would simply not conduct business that day if I were a day trader.

investing,"So let's say a bank has $10,000 in it's vault and it owes $10,000 to all the accounts it has total. 

So, now let's say it lends out $1,000. Meaning it now has $9,000 in it's vault yet owes $10,000 to all accounts in total. 

Then the $1,000 eventually comes back to the bank through whoever the debtor gave the money to. Meaning the bank now has $10,000 in the bank yet $11,000 it owes to all accounts in total. 

So this leaves us with one person owing the bank let's say with 0% APR $1,000 for simplicity. 

Now this is the part where people commonly say money is ""created"" which doesn't make sense to me. So how does he pay it back, well usually people borrow because they don't have money now but eventually will, so let's say his employer takes out $1,000 from the bank and gives it to him. 

This means the bank now has $9,000 in reserves and owes $10,000 to all accounts. The debtor pays back $1,000 leaving the bank with $10,000 in reserves and $10,000 it owes to all debtors. However was money created, it just moved.

investing,"I’ve only been investing for about two months. I’m a super beginner and I am just learning as I go. Not tried anything like options yet. 

But the overall rule I’ve found to be 100% true for me so far: 

Anytime I invest in a company I literally didn’t know anything about previously I lose. 
If it’s a company or industry I’ve never understood or that I’ve never bought product from or just don’t have any prior understanding of that company, I never guess correctly. 
This might be obvious, but it’s easy to get pulled into a headline or some company you just heard about. 

My only successes have been with companies i do actually know and can just use basic logic in guessing whether the climate is ok for them at this moment. If I genuinely believe that a certain company can thrive in this environment and that their services are still relevant, then I have a chance in being correct. 

If I read some random article mentioning a stock I’ve never heard of, maybe that article is right. But I have zero past knowledge to be able to judge it by. I will still probably continue to make dumb choices again and again. 

But I have realized it really is best to trust my intuition and gut. 
I can’t really have intuition about a stock I’ve never heard of before. I have zero input to that. 
With any company I personally know about my chances of anticipating the future must be much much better than if I have zero knowledge. 

It’s not that I have to have literally been a loyal customer to that one business. But just having prior awareness and understanding counts for something. If you already considered a company to be an all around valuable entity with a quality product or niche, then that counts for a lot. 

Anyway, my advice to any other new investors is to stick to companies you’ve heard of before. Don’t put money into something you have zero real world understanding of. If you personally have anecdotal evidence that confirms a company is of good quality and value in its industry that counts for something. Stocks you’ve never heard of or have never interacted with in the real world are basically smoke and mist times 2. You literally cannot comment on their value. And all you know is bullshit headlines that obviously have an agenda in their reporting. 

You could still gain something from the volatility right now. But investing in a stock that is existing on literally only new headlines is a lot more risky than anything. This is especially true with biotech stocks right now. You should have at least some tether to the real world in your personal experience of that companies value or position in the industry.",It is best to stick to companies I’ve heard of before

However, I do know I want to become a real estate investor, and as Warren Buffet says, be greedy when everyone is fearful. 

I was wondering about those of you that have used or are currently using the BHA living off base with a spouse.

As of right now, I'm thinking about joining enlisted at E-4 doing cyber security for the Army or Air Force. I only plan on staying in for about 3-4 years. I honestly don't want to stay in longer than that.

I would bring my spouse along with me and hopefully purchase a multifamily residence where we get located as my first investment property. But, I would also want to rent out the units we're not occupying, or, if it's SFR, then renting out by the room.

Is this possible with the BHA and are any of you doing anything like what I'm considering?

Best,

investing,"Over a decade since Bitcoin was first launched, there are now myriad cryptocurrencies on the market, such as NEO, Litecoin and Ethereum, but Bitcoin still remains the most well-known. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency, which requires no central banking system. It sits on a platform called blockchain, and Bitcoins are ‘mined’ in exchange for Bitcoin rewards. Anyone can mine Bitcoin, and because the transactions have to be verified by several individuals, there is no need for a central bank to control it, it is decentralised. But you don’t have to mine Bitcoin in order to own it, many people are now simply investing in cryptocurrencies through trading platforms. 

But is cryptocurrency a good investment? And if so, will 2020 be a good year to invest? It’s certainly been an interesting year so far, and a rocky ride in terms of many investments, with prices fluctuating, largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The value of Bitcoin has risen as high as $9,000 and seen a low of $4,000, before gaining ground to $6,600, marking the greatest fluctuations since 2017. 

The most recent rise in Bitcoin’s value, as well as other cryptocurrencies, may have been triggered by US Federal Reserve quantitative easing, an attempt to reduce the damage Coronavirus could cause to the economy. This has led some to move investments into Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, to hedge against the potential devaluing of currency caused by quantitative easing. As there is a finite number of Bitcoin on the market, some believe it should not be susceptible to such devaluing, as the amount of new Bitcoin being mined is always reducing. The increase in demand, and the reduction in supply, should drive up the value, in keeping with the principles of supply and demand, according to experts such as Simon Peters, a crypto analyst at eToro. 

Cryptocurrencies first became popular after the economic crisis of 2008, when the value of other traditional shares and investments took a major hit. Similarly, since news of the Coronavirus outbreak first hit, transaction volumes on trading platforms seemed to have increased.

Cryptocurrency trading platforms Binance and MyEtherWallet have also seen increased investment and significant growth. It certainly appears that quantitative easing has been the catalyst for investors to seek alternative options. 

But there’s another reason to consider cryptocurrency investment in 2020 – the Bitcoin halving this May, meaning the number of Bitcoin available will halve. This means less supply, and with the pandemic pushing up demand, some are anticipating a bull run.

If past performance is any indication, a halving is likely to push Bitcoin values up. The first halving in 2012 saw a whopping 8,000% increase in the value of Bitcoin over the following year, and the second one in 2016 saw Bitcoin’s value rise by 2,000% in the subsequent 18 months.

With no clear end in sight for the current lockdown situation, many businesses are losing value, if they survive at all, so traditional stocks and shares are taking a battering. Could cryptocurrencies be considered a safe haven in 2020? It is a fluctuating market, but steely investors may be prepared to take a punt.

investing,"The Federal Open Market Committee released minutes Wednesday from its most recent meeting, which concluded April 29 with the central bank’s policymaking arm holding steady on interest rates.

After slashing its benchmark rate to near zero as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the FOMC voted to keep the rate there in a range between 0% and 0.25% and not move it until a recovery is firmly in place.

The action came as central bank officials noted the excessive damage the virus was doing to the economy and the potential for damage ahead.

“Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the economic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to economic activity in the medium term,” the minutes said.

One area of particular concern is what should happen in the event that coronavirus infections should surge later in the year. The minutes noted that the “more pessimistic” outlook for a rebound was probably as likely as the baseline forecast for improvement.

“In this scenario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict restrictions on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin around year-end, inducing a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year,” the summary said.

As far as specific threats, the meeting summary noted vulnerability to the banking sector and the potential for bankruptcies from nonfinancial companies.

They also noted the danger of high unemployment levels as workers became separated from the workforce.

In addition to the pledge on rates, Chairman Jerome Powell discussed the multiple measures the Fed has taken since early March. The central bank also instituted nearly a dozen liquidity and lending programs aimed at maintaining market function and getting money to needy areas of the economy.

Millions of people are behind on their credit-card and auto-loan payments, the latest sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s financial devastation.

Lenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in “financial hardship” programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.

Nearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.

The numbers have surged from a year ago, when 0.03% of credit cards and about 0.5% of auto loans were in financial-hardship programs.

The spike in unemployment caused by the coronavirus has strained people’s ability to make their monthly debt payments. To make matters worse, Americans were tapping credit cards and auto loans at record levels even before the pandemic to deal with rising costs and stagnant incomes.

As coronavirus cases surged in the U.S. and businesses shut down, millions of people told their lenders they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills. Some lenders have allowed borrowers to miss payments for as long as several months on credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.

investing,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

\[Excerpt\]  Now that we’re beginning – just beginning – to emerge from the anti-coronavirus shutdowns, and the economy is starting to open up, one obvious question is begging for an answer. The restart, of society of the economy, will depend on the success we encounter in lifting trade and travel restriction. How soon will that happen, and will it happen soon enough?

For the airline industry, at least one answer may be obvious: the restart cannot come soon enough. Airlines have famously thin margins, and with long-distance and international travel simply stopped and air traffic down by 90%, they have been hemorrhaging cash. While the larger airlines may have the resources to survive, there is no doubt that at least some smaller airlines will go under.

Writing from Credit Suisse, airline industry analyst [Jose Caiado](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/jose-caiado) sees some hope. Low share prices now make an attractive point of entry, and Caiado notes that, as society reopens, air travel will inevitably resume its essential function. There is simply no other efficient way to handle rapid long-distance travel. The key for investors will be finding those airlines best positioned to both to weather the downturn and quickly resume operations.

“We believe industry has adequate liquidity to bridge through to an eventual demand recovery, which we expect towards the end of 2020. However, balance sheets are now heavily burdened with incremental leverage, and debt reduction will become industry’s primary strategic objective as it emerges from the crisis,” Caiado noted.

On a practical note, for investors, Caiado points out three airlines that are solid bets to survive the corona crisis and make gains in the restart.",3 Airline Stocks to Bet on After the Coronavirus Crash

Hello friends. So ever since this pandemic hit, I’ve been floating around the idea of financial freedom, so I’ve been researching a lot deeper into the stock market and investing. Since March, I’ve learned an exponential amount thanks to YouTube. I just opened up my first fidelity investment account and have invested into one mutual fund. I am planning on opening up a Roth IRA as well as investing in more index funds. 
Although investing is one of the best ways to use your money, I’ve also been flirting with researching into real estate. According to many wealthy people, real estate has the most potential to become very wealthy much faster than investing a few decades into the stock market. Ideally, I would like to buy a duplex or triplex, and reside in one so I can have it all paid off while I work. The thing is, in order to do this I need to have money saved to put down at least 20%. 
So my question is, should I continue to invest tiny amounts into the stock market every month while saving to buy my first property, or should I invest larger amounts and ave up slowly? I make a little less than the average American income. For those who are experienced in both fields, what would you advise?

investing,"Hello!
I have an indirectly related investment issue/question that I wonder if anybody else has gone through?
I began investing about a year ago. I’m 29. 
I’m late to the game but got my act together and looking forward to The rewards of my long-term buy-and-hold strategy late on. I am in no way daytrading or doing anything other than purchasing an Index fun once or twice a month and holding it.

It all started when I mentioned to my Parents that they should start a Roth IRA for my recently turned 18 younger sibling. I explained to them the benefits and general idea. 

After a few days of bringing it up and recommending it to them, my dad finally snapped via text message And told me to get get-rich-quick scheme’s out of my head, to stop polluting my younger sibling with notions that are just gambling and that nobody ever got rich off of “the stocks”.
He keeps all his money in the bank, cash, and a few gold pieces. 
And he owns 3 homes. 

It’s not going to be a one time thing and if they ever catch any wind of any kind of investing on my part it’s going to be a whole thing all over and it’s just going to be me looking over my shoulder at what I say at any time. (Example: They might be planning a trip at dinner, and I might say I can’t go for a month. 
They will dig deeper and eventually I’ll have to answer “because I am putting down my Roth 6000 payment in that month, if it’s all the same I’m happy to join in a month”) 
. Or even something as simple as them bring it up and asking if I’m still doing that sort of thing.

it will inevitably end in raised voices and further shunning/outcasting from family.  

I know it sounds like I should just ignore it and keep on keeping on course.
But it’s having a big enough effect on me, to the point where it’s deterring me from continuing my Roth IRA contributions. 
But my parents are very overbearing and it’s just part of their culture to be in every aspect of their children’s life forever and it’s just the biggest deal when the smallest thing happens.

It may sound stupid the sun and it is…
The culture bubble is really hard to assimilate in a different country but hey I don’t make the rules it is the way it is…

5)I keep emergency cash at home (1k) along with a few small gold coins.(about 2k worth)
6) my credit cards are consistently underutilized (1-5%) and paid off monthly.

My bills are paid and I live very frugally with the exceptional dinner out with friends once maybe twice a month, and the occasional mall purchase. I’m happy where I am.

investing,"# **What are Oil Futures?**

An [oil futures contract](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/crude-oil-futures.aspx) is an agreement between a potential buyer and a oil manufacturer to purchase 1,000 barrels of oil (per contract). This oil is then delivered to a town called [Cushing, Oklahoma, USA](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/lessons/the-importance-of-cushing-oklahoma.html). There, a buyer is either expected to store it or transport it elsewhere (typically via pipeline). The figurative meeting of buyer and seller in Cushing, OK is called [*taking delivery*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp) and it happens on the [third Friday of every third month](https://www.thebalance.com/guide-to-futures-market-expiration-dates-1031175).

## **Oil as an Investment**

Oil contracts are not only for those expecting or able to take delivery of physical oil. It can also be [sold and traded like any other commodity](https://www.thebalance.com/trading-crude-oil-futures-809351) for a price. Traders pay a predetermined [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072815/what-does-futures-contract-cost.asp) for the opportunity to open a futures contract, which can amplify any potential losses or gains. When traders exchange oil contracts, they are attempting to make a [profit between what they bought the contract for, and what they sold it for](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/12/what-are-crude-oil-futures-and-how-do-they-work.aspx). This creates an issue at the end of the month, when delivery must be taken by someone. Often times, traders do not have the capital, means, or reason to take delivery, so they sell close to the contracts expiry date. Most of the time, those who have the means, reason, and capital to take delivery purchase the contracts from the traders, but it is important to note that unlike options where there is a “option” to act on a contract, futures are [required to take physical delivery](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp) by the final owner.

## **Negative Oil**

In May 2020, an [abnormality occurred in the Oil Futures market](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-contracts-cme-grp/cme-group-as-oil-contract-plunges-negative-says-markets-working-fine-idUSL1N2C82MD). Due to a sudden plummet of demand due to the [COVD-19 pandemic and lack of storage options](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/04/21/heres-what-negative-oil-prices-really-mean/#733f6b95a85d) to store surplus oil, Oil briefly turned negative. In parallel, it is [expensive and risky to shut down a rig](https://www.wired.com/story/the-world-is-still-producing-more-oil-than-it-needs-why/) that is already running or tapped into, so production remained somewhat stable. To remedy this, contract holders began to pay for another party to store the oil, making the price of [oil effectively negative](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/842095406/episode-993-negative-oil). While ultimately short lived, oil is closely watched as an indicator of economic health.

The delivery of oil is known as [*Texas light sweet crude oil*](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/why-futures/welcome-to-nymex-wti-light-sweet-crude-oil-futures.html) and is considered a light oil due to its density.

investing,"\# \*\*What are Oil Futures?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

An \[oil futures contract\]([https://www.theoptionsguide.com/crude-oil-futures.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/crude-oil-futures.aspx)) is an agreement between a potential buyer and a oil manufacturer to purchase 1,000 barrels of oil (per contract). This oil is then delivered to a town called \[Cushing, Oklahoma, USA\]([https://www.cmegroup.com/education/lessons/the-importance-of-cushing-oklahoma.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/lessons/the-importance-of-cushing-oklahoma.html)). There, a buyer is either expected to store it or transport it elsewhere (typically via pipeline). The figurative meeting of buyer and seller in Cushing, OK is called \[\*taking delivery\*\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp)) and it happens on the \[third Friday of every third month\]([https://www.thebalance.com/guide-to-futures-market-expiration-dates-1031175](https://www.thebalance.com/guide-to-futures-market-expiration-dates-1031175)).

&amp;#x200B;

\## \*\*Oil as an Investment\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Oil contracts are not only for those expecting or able to take delivery of physical oil. It can also be \[sold and traded like any other commodity\]([https://www.thebalance.com/trading-crude-oil-futures-809351](https://www.thebalance.com/trading-crude-oil-futures-809351)) for a price. Traders pay a predetermined \[margin\]([https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072815/what-does-futures-contract-cost.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072815/what-does-futures-contract-cost.asp)) for the opportunity to open a futures contract, which can amplify any potential losses or gains. When traders exchange oil contracts, they are attempting to make a \[profit between what they bought the contract for, and what they sold it for\]([https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/12/what-are-crude-oil-futures-and-how-do-they-work.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/12/what-are-crude-oil-futures-and-how-do-they-work.aspx)). This creates an issue at the end of the month, when delivery must be taken by someone. Often times, traders do not have the capital, means, or reason to take delivery, so they sell close to the contracts expiry date. Most of the time, those who have the means, reason, and capital to take delivery purchase the contracts from the traders, but it is important to note that unlike options where there is a “option” to act on a contract, futures are \[required to take physical delivery\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp)) by the final owner.

&amp;#x200B;

\## \*\*Negative Oil\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In May 2020, an \[abnormality occurred in the Oil Futures market\]([https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-contracts-cme-grp/cme-group-as-oil-contract-plunges-negative-says-markets-working-fine-idUSL1N2C82MD](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-contracts-cme-grp/cme-group-as-oil-contract-plunges-negative-says-markets-working-fine-idUSL1N2C82MD)). Due to a sudden plummet of demand due to the \[COVD-19 pandemic and lack of storage options\]([https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/04/21/heres-what-negative-oil-prices-really-mean/#733f6b95a85d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/04/21/heres-what-negative-oil-prices-really-mean/#733f6b95a85d)) to store surplus oil, Oil briefly turned negative. In parallel, it is \[expensive and risky to shut down a rig\]([https://www.wired.com/story/the-world-is-still-producing-more-oil-than-it-needs-why/](https://www.wired.com/story/the-world-is-still-producing-more-oil-than-it-needs-why/)) that is already running or tapped into, so production remained somewhat stable. To remedy this, contract holders began to pay for another party to store the oil, making the price of \[oil effectively negative\]([https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/842095406/episode-993-negative-oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/842095406/episode-993-negative-oil)). While ultimately short lived, oil is closely watched as an indicator of economic health. If a trend of negative prices were to emerge, it could be a negative signal to the \[overall economic health\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/how-oil-prices-impact-us-economy.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/how-oil-prices-impact-us-economy.asp)).

I've been enjoying my time in the market. I've found thus far, that it is about staying calm and maintaining your emotions. 

There are valuable perspectives to learn from, but theyre not principles. 

Since February I have

- bought and sold at a loss
- Donated to charitt
- trimmed my portfolio twice 
- invested in ETFs strategically for exposure and increased long term risk
- purchased and learned from various industries
- stuck to my beliefs
- read 10Ks, analyzed company histories
- used my personal expertise in computer science to apply game theory or increase product knowledge




I believe that it has been crunch time since the crash and that the people that put in the most hours will have more protection against market forces. 

I also believe that you should only modestly invest in options when you have a killshot. I'm not rich so there's no sense in me making a super mega play. Im 2x but patient and calm. There will always be opportunities.

I also don't want to pay this much to the market as I already have my set of investment priorities between stocks and retirement planning, so I offset it with video games, focusing on my work, and building my own stuff.

investing,"The most popular stocks on Robinhood are meme stocks and distressed assets like airlines. IMO distressed asset investing is an art form and I don't know how to do it well so I stay away from it, and I suspect most of the people buying them because it's ""cheap"" are going to lose their shirts. 

That said, here are some stocks I do like in this market. Happy to hear your thoughts. Disclosure: I own them or am waiting for an opportunity to pick them up:

&amp;#x200B;

**GLD and GDX -** GDX is a gold miner ETF that trades like a leveraged version of GLD. In particular, I think the options on GDX are outrageously cheap. 8/21 40c is only $2.40, the stock trades at $37, and it was up almost $7 is just the last 30 days while gold has been stalling. That option will be profitable if GDX can go up $6 more in the next *3 months*. Whether or not it's successful depends on the price of gold and I am bullish on gold. 

Gold is a traditional safe-haven asset against both recessions and inflation. It also functions as an alternative to the dollar for international commerce when dollars are scarce or the nations involved are under sanction (Venezuela shipped Iran a few tons of gold in exchange for refined fuels). On long run charts, gold has multi-year periods of outperformance against stocks. The most recent gold bullrun started in mid-2018, and I figure it might just accelerate through this crash, especially as the US government announces record spending and lending programs. 

What crushes this trade? Strong economic growth with low inflation. I don't see that happening anytime soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IPOB.U and IPOC.U -** These are two blank check funds raised by investor Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital. The IPO price was $10 and each share is backed by about $10 in cash. He intends to use the funds to buy up private tech companies and take them public through the back door. Make sure you buy in multiples of 3, because each share comes with 1/3 of a warrant to buy an additional share at $11.50. I figure whenever he ends up turning this cash pile into companies, it will probably move up on hype alone. 

The last fund he raised like this merged with Virgin Galactic, taking it public. IPOC is internationally focused and IPOB is USA focused. The "".U"" stands for ""unit"" and means that unit comes with the share and the warrant. Later the warrants and shares will trade separately

&amp;#x200B;

**Cloud Computing (NET, TWLO) -** Some of these have run up substantially in recent days so you might want to wait on a good price. Fortunately, the moderna announcement on Monday triggered a ""virus is over!"" trade and investors dumped these in favor of casinos, cruise ships, and Live Nation and I got a few shares at a discount. 

As a developer I used Cloudflare and Twilio and I know a lot of people that do too. The fact that they turned in great Q1s encouraged me. I like that their market caps are medium-sized so they have plenty of room to grow. . Cloudflare is used by over 10% of all the websites on the internet. I do worry that as the recession picks up, corporate spend might be cut back and that might impact even so far impregnable tech companies. And they do have competitors. These companies are higher risk and higher potential reward than big-cap tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Big Tech (long: MSFT and AMZN, short: AAPL, TSLA, neutral: FB, NFLX, GOOGL) -** I know these companies are huge already but I expect MSFT and AMZN will continue to hit new all-time highs and will see uninterrupted business growth. On down days in the market, MSFT dips below $180 and AMZN below $2400 and I like that as a buying opportunity. These companies sell necessities for home and business and they are not going anywhere. 

I believe that luxury product makers like AAPL and TSLA are going to have a rough year. I wouldn't short them  because they have strong meme power and it will take Q2 earnings disappointments before they really drop. 

FB and Google have a substantial amount of their revenue come from ads. This hasn't hurt their bottom lines *so far.* But it might. I like the new business lines facebook is getting into (more ecommerce, the Jio share purchase). I will nibble up a few FB shares on down days. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Entertainment Tech (ROKU, Video Games) -** The street didn't love Roku's earning call for some reason but they are growing revenue 70% y/y and they are a solid Covid company. The poor near-term share performance I view as an opportunity to buy in. 

Obviously, video games are a growing industry and are booming under COVID conditions. But a lot of these companies have seen very strong share growth so I'm just picking up a share or two when the price breaks lower.",Bull Ideas for a Bear Market

investing,"Obviously this isn't a flashy name and what they sell isn't sexy but hear me out. This company makes all the random shit you see in grocery stores, food stalls, cafeterias, movie theaters, stadiums: Super Pretzels, ICEE, Slush Puppie, churros, minute maid popsicles, funnel cakes, italian ice, bakery goods, etc. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service (#1 revenue stream), Frozen Beverages (#2) , and Retail Supermarket (#3).

Since 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. Now enter in the beer flu, that streak will snap as everything they sell into is closed except for supermarket. Q1 earnings, as expected, were trash:

Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)
Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year. Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year. Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago.

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it even takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

Idk, let me know what you guys think",$JJSF long term play
investing,"There's been a lot of talk (most of it bullish) about Moderna, the biotech company with the first Covid-19 vaccine in the pipeline. I think a vaccine can be developed, but there doesn't seem to be enough skepticism about Moderna's chance of pulling it off. Even after today's 10 percent drop, the company has a $26 billion market cap, more than 3x the pre-Covid-19 value, which was itself speculative.

The gist of the bear case is that:

\-No one has ever developed an mRNA vaccine (it's cool tech that may or may not work) and Moderna has never brought a drug to market.

\-Moderna hasn't published much data about any of its research and nothing meaningful about the corona virus vaccine.

\-The phase 1 trial is just a safety trial -- it's a not big hurdle for a vaccine candidate to pass. The results that n = 8 test subjects had neutralizing antibodies is a far bigger deal and some of yesterday's run up was justified. But there were no numbers and there's always reasons for skepticism when you don't have a control arm ( as is the case in a phase 1 trial).

\-Again mRNA vaccines are thought to be less stable than protein based vaccines. A protein based vaccine is a safer bet.

investing,"We all recently learned that the Fed will boost the money supply to any extent to keep the “economy” in ok shape. We also learned this boosts stock prices a lot. So do widespread shutdowns that force people to save because huge swathes of the real economy for goods and services is shutdown. The Fed’s new money doesn’t have much place to go but to assets, and cash flows for people that still work also don’t have much place to go but assets (saving rate spiked up), and hence the S&amp;P 500 is doing fine as the US is on track to have Great Depression levels of unemployment. 

However. Many states are starting to open back up and allow the real economy to start up again. Prices on everything will be low because of the slowdown, while the valuation multiples for equities are sky high (Q1 earnings doesn’t show us the full picture, but Q2 will). So as things open up, not only will savings rates (read: money funneled towards assets) fall back down, but also people might want to sell assets at rich valuations to buy goods and services at fire sale prices.

investing,"&gt; Heavy hearts soared Monday with news that Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate — the frontrunner in the American market — seemed to be generating an immune response in Phase 1 trial subjects. The company’s stock valuation also surged, hitting $29 billion, an astonishing feat for a company that currently sells zero products.
&gt;
&gt; But was there good reason for so much enthusiasm? Several vaccine experts asked by STAT concluded that, based on the information made available by the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, there’s really no way to know how impressive — or not — the vaccine may be.
&gt;
&gt; While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words, not data. That’s important: If you ask scientists to read a journal article, they will scour data tables, not corporate statements. With science, numbers speak much louder than words.
&gt;

investing,"""Too much money chasing too few goods = inflation"" - I get that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought experiment:

I say there were 100 apples, and everyone needed 1 to survive, and there are 100 people with $1 per person, then everyone could survive. But what if the money supply increased to $200 ($2 per person)... Well then I suppose Apple sellers would raise their prices to match... But it does seem awfully odd that Apple suppliers are able to figure how much money people have in their pockets and are quick enough to adjust prices accordingly. But let's just say they can and do - and the government doesn't try to stop them like Venezuela or Zimbabwe. Then yea, I suppose we would be balanced by the actual supply.

On the other end, if everyone was given $100 million, then yea, that would seem kind of absurd because essentially American's would now be the wealthiest nation on earth and able to buy anything from anyone... At-least until those goods, like the Apple suppliers, adjusted for the value of our dollar?

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't understand is say, if economic wealth is tied to supply, productivity etc, why then doesn't a government just print money to build and invest in the country's infrastructure to increase that supply and productivity?

""You don't have a place to live?!"" - boom we print money to pay developers to build a house

""You want to create jobs?"", - boom we print more money to create jobs to build a factory

""You can't afford medication?"" - boom here's money for you

If the United States is the worlds reserve currency...

So we try to tether ourselves to reality (of supply) and reasonableness (printing $100 million per person is not reasonable) by backing our currencies to several across the world. Though wouldn't this give those who hold reserve currency status (like the United States) tremendous power to just print their money? **In other words, if a country has its debt denominated in its own currency and holds a reserve currency status, what's to stop them from just doing whatever they want?

After getting a little more acquainted with investing by reading around on here, watching some videos, listening to some podcasts, getting a little indirect exposure through college, etc. I'm wondering if I'm not better served over the long term by just moving towards higher dividend yields now. Like a lot of people I got started with/still use Robinhood. Now that they have the fractional buying and DRIP I can also take my dividends and put them right back into the holdings.  I've never sold any of my holdings before, and I don't want to make any rash decisions. Would the smaller overall growth + the reinvestment of the dividends go further towards my goals? Or would the growth ETFs, and the taxes I'd have to start paying on the dividends hamper long term wealth building?

Then just as a follow up, if moving \*is\* the right choice. Is it generally better to move away from ETFs and focus on the individual stocks that make up groups like the Dividend Aristocrats, or stick with ETFs?

&gt; Also, the restrictions on rent placed in February and March will be lifted, indicating the beginning of 6 months of nonpayments for mortgages and thus beginning of foreclosure proceedings.

&gt; Individuals with multiple mortgages won't have people renting their property as much since people will move in with family due to hardship, as what happened in 2008.

&gt; Banks already put a stop to Home Equity Lines of Credit, back in March, which means a lot property owners that rely on rental income to pay their mortgages, will essentially not be able to pay them, or take a line of credit based on their equity, to pay their mortgage (floating). There will be numerous foreclosures, banks gonna bank, people gonna hurt.

&gt; The Federal Reserve has a $0 reserve requirement at the moment, since that was lifted. People can't pay their bills, their credit lines (cards, loans, mortgages, HELOCS) will go into default, and banks are going to take bigger losses. With no reserve requirement, banks are going to become more unstable as people don't pay their debts.

Bond investors have hit out at the growing trend of companies reporting “earnings before coronavirus”, warning that this new pandemic-era financial metric could allow businesses to use imaginary numbers to raise more debt than they can handle.

Fund managers have long complained about the heavy adjustments riskier companies make to their earnings when borrowing from the high-yield bond market, often as part of an attempt by their private-equity owners to massage leverage levels — or the ratio of debt to operating profits — to make buyouts look safer.

But several companies recently pushed this one stage further by reporting their “ebitdac” — earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and coronavirus — for the first quarter of 2020. The number is supposed to reflect profits the companies believe they would have made, were it not for virus-related lockdowns and disruptions to supply chains.

The European Leveraged Finance Association, a group representing investors in higher-risk corporate bonds and loans, has warned that it would be “inappropriate” for companies to use the metric to calculate how much debt they are allowed to raise under their arrangements with lenders.

ELFA, which formed last year to protect the interests of corporate debt investors, added that “reliance on fictitious figures” could lead to a downward spiral of companies raising money that they cannot repay.

Debt deals often include terms and conditions known as covenants, which are designed to protect investors by imposing restrictions that stop businesses from taking on debt they cannot afford to pay back.


	
Investors are worried that businesses could use “ebitdac” to calculate leverage ratios under these covenants and therefore evade restrictions on how much they can borrow.

“Using ebitdac to paint a rosier picture on an investor presentation would be bad enough, but using it to raise additional debt which [ranks ahead of] the existing investors would simply be inappropriate,” said Brian Abdelhadi, senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors.

German manufacturer Schenck Process last week became the first European company to include the phrase ebitdac in its financial reporting according to 9Fin, a financial data service that tracks about 500 high-yield bond issuers.

The metric allowed Schenck, which is owned by US private equity firm Blackstone, to report a lower leverage multiple than if it had used the traditional ebitda measure, bringing down its ratio of net debt to earnings from 5.3 times to 5 times.

Covenant Review, a research firm that specialises in analysing debt documents, said that the language in Schenck’s presentation indicated that the company “may be intending to use this measure as the basis for testing metrics under its financing documents”.

“Other companies might push the envelope even farther with larger and still more attenuated adjustments,” analysts at Covenant Review warned.

Schenck said ebitdac was included “to give an idea of the estimated impact of the pandemic on the company so far” and that “this did not distort any disclosure”.

The manufacturer added that the metric was “included in relation to covenant compliance where the adjustment is permitted following the stipulations of the contractual framework”.

Investors also voiced concerns about companies raising debt based on coronavirus-adjusted historic earnings figures. Peter Aspbury, lead portfolio manager for European high yield at JPMorgan Asset Management, said this would allow businesses “to basically distort the reality enough to the detriment of creditors”.

He added that loose definitions becoming the norm could allow companies to relax covenant terms for any number of unfavourable events.

“It shows how far the moral compass has deteriorated,” said Tatjana Greil Castro, a portfolio manager at Muzinich &amp; Co. “They’re living in a parallel universe.”","Bond investors' angst as companies create new financial reporting called EBITDAC, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortization and Coronavirus"

Unemployment was low prior to the virus, but the labor participation rate was 3 percentage points or so below the 25 years leading up to the housing bubble. In other words, the job market wasn't nearly as strong as the unemployment rate itself would lead you to believe. Also notice how long it took for the unemployment level to get back to ""normal"".

( [https://www.gurufocus.com/shiller-PE.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/shiller-PE.php) )

**Shiller P/E Implied Market Return**

If we assume that over the long term, the Shiller P/E of the market will reverse to its historical mean of $mean, the future market return will come from three parts:

1. Contraction or expansion of the Schiller P/E to the historical mean
2. Dividends
3. Business growth

This, to  me, tells me that at some point the Shiller P/E might get back to its mean level of 17 of the current level of 30 something. Now, from the paragraph above it is easy to understand that no crash is necessary for it to return to the mean levels. Business growth and dividend increase will reduce the P/E and bring the Shiller ratio back down to ""normal"" values.  So my question is, why use this falsely as an economic crash predictor, when in reality it can go down in value by way of increasing earnings and dividend returns? If theoretically economy does well and recovers from this situation and sales keep going up, this indicator will go down without a massive crash. I think is easy for people to say ""oh it is up, a market crash might be inbound, lets short the market "" (although we just had  correction /black swan whatever you wanna call it) .

A German manufacturing company is being investigated for fraud after allegedly conning the legendary US investor Warren Buffett into paying at least four times over the odds for its business by Photoshopping company orders and invoices.

In February 2017 a unit of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc paid €800m (£715m) to buy Wilhelm Schulz, a family-run manufacturer of stainless steel based in Krefeld, western Germany – a rare foray into the world of family-run *mittelstand* companies for the tycoon, estimated to be the fourth-wealthiest person in the world.

After an anonymous tip-off by a whistleblower in May the same year, however, the US holding company began to question whether key documents had been doctored to create the impression of a booming business.

In reality, the company Buffett had just purchased was struggling and at risk of bankruptcy.

On 9 April a New York arbitration court ruled that the German company had systematically led investors astray in the run-up to the purchase and then tried to cover its tracks afterwards.

📷[**Warren Buffett dumps US airline stocks, saying 'world has changed' after Covid-19Read more**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/warren-buffett-dumps-us-airline-stocks-saying-world-has-changed-after-covid-19)

“This is not a close case,” the panel said in a 132-page ruling. “The evidence strongly points to fraud, and there is little in the record to suggest otherwise.”

Internal documents cited by the German newspaper Handelsblatt suggest some of Wilhelm Schulz’s employees inflated the company’s Ebitda – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – by simply scanning in letterheads of third companies and Photoshopping them to create fake orders and invoices.

At least 47 business deals that had helped create the impression of a company on the up were completely fabricated, said Handelsblatt.

The New York arbitration court agreed with Buffett’s company, Precision Castparts Corp, that the German business was worth no more than €157m, and ordered Schulz to make up the difference of €643m.

investing,"Upon reading several sources, various authors, including Bogle, say that the average expected returns of the US total stock market for the next 30 or so years are likely to decline from the annualized returns we have seen thus far in recent decades. 

But, generally I have heard others say that no one can predict the economic power of the US. Persons like Buffett have even gone on to suggest that the US is still the best bet in BRK's recent shareholder meeting. 

Lets say, if the annualized returns of the S&amp;P 500 reach approx 1-5% instead of double digit figures then would it not make economic sense to at least attempt to beat the market through more selective methods (i.e., value investing and stock picking?)

\* US government debt will surpass **$27 trillion** for FY ending 9/30/20 assuming no additional COVID-19 stimulus passed. Does not include unfunded liabilities (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security). Conservative estimates pin at **$100 trillion**.

\* **35% of the S&amp;P 500 index** aggregate market cap concentrated across 15 largest publicly-traded companies (as of May 2020) and 26% of S&amp;P 500 market cap concentrated across FAMANG.

investing,"Hey Everyone, 

We don't have to look far in the markets to see dozens of stocks outperforming the major indices. From your thoughts, will the below companies maintain the tremendous upside they have had so far this year? I know this discussion is contingent on many variables that are unknown, but I would love to see different viewpoints.   

These stocks have made decent runups compared to the broader market, and I think its good to note whether long term consumer preferences have changed going forward. I see a long term change in many markets, and wouldn't touch anything commercial real estate related with a ten-foot pole given dynamic business demand and the new work from home culture(that appears to be working well from many companies). Also, many restaurants and brick and mortar stores I'm more hesitant on. I look forward to your responses!

2) Netflix

3)Peloton

4) Zoom

5) Apple

6) Microsoft

7)Verizon 

8) Sony

investing,"As some of you may know - Vanguard is owned by its funds and by being a shareholder of a Vanguard fund, you become an owner of Vanguard. 

[VIPERS](https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/ETF_total_stock_market_index.html) were a novel concept patented by Vanguard that allows mutual funds to gain similar tax advantages to ETFs. 

&gt;Theoretically, patents are supposed to stimulate innovation. This instance demonstrates - yet again - how patents can stifle innovation. It is likely the case that competitors won't even bother to introduce similar products because of this patent. This hurts consumers as they have less selection as a result of less competition. Additionally, having an etf as a shareclass of a mutual fund makes good business sense independent of whether its patentable. Vanguard would have introduced the product regardless of whether it had a patent. So, in summary, the ability to patent in this instance didn't stimulate the innovation, and it has since stifled innovation.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am curious how we, the shareholders of Vanguard funds, supposedly the owners of Vanguard, benefit from these patents? If not, why waste time and money creating/advancing/enforcing such patents. The only answer I can see if that Vanguard is doing what is best for Vanguard business, with little eye towards whether such a move provides any benefit to Vanguard shareholders. Seems their focus may be a little off.

TL;DR

As a shareholder of Vanguard, do you believe it is ok for Vanguard to engage in anti-competitive practices? Patents cost money.

It doesn't seem like economic data can really get any worse after May barring more shutdowns, and it seems that any progress will be seen as a positive in this environment. Unemployment of 23% in June won't turn the market if it was 25% in May. Retail sales can't get worse since stores will actually be open. We can't get farther away from a vaccine, and even the most insignificant progress can pump the markets like a trillion dollars stimulus as we saw today.

# It’s the Honest Management Teams You Need to Watch Out For

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**“...while nobody should be judged only at his worst, how he deals with hard times says far more about a man than his waltz down easy street...”** *– Scott Raab*

There’s no shame in admitting to it.

We’re all flying blind in the age of COVID-19. And when there aren’t any precedents to lean on, it’s tempting to put your faith in the words of managers you’ve been able to rely on in the past.

But don’t be surprised to learn over the coming months that the executives you trust most – the ones that own lots of stock, responsibly allocate capital, and prioritize transparency – don’t have the level of integrity you’ve been assigning them.

**The unfortunate truth is that good behavior is often the luxury of good fortune rather than the cause of it.**

After enough experience, most public markets investors have been lied to and seen their capital squandered more times than they’d care to admit. Warning about management’s integrity may come off as an accusation of naivete.

*Of course management is greedy and just in it for themselves!*

But most of us have also found “exceptions to the rule.”

These are the executives that under-promise and over-deliver. They admit their mistakes and openly discuss challenges the company faces. They prioritize returns on investment above growth. Transparency is limited only by what must be withheld for competitive reasons.

We actually admire these executives, and though we may hesitate to admit it to ourselves, we are more emotionally attached to these investments than is prudent.

But how hard is it to behave intelligently and honestly when the wind is at your back? The true test is how management responds to a crisis.

This earnings season, I’m noticing a pattern of managers I’ve long respected being evasive and making forecasts based on hope as opposed to facts.

While it may not always be clear whether this is dishonesty or delusion, I am confident of this: **While the world is in crisis mode, if a manager you admire makes statements contrary to your common-sense view of the situation, err on the side of caution**.

Don’t get comfortable with promises of sufficient liquidity and near-term demand recovery based on the word of a manager experiencing desperation for the first time.

Mall-operator Simon Property Group (SPG) is one recent example of this.

Years ago, the company was considered a best-in-class REIT. SPG's CEO (David Simon) was transparent and quick to admit problems, even if he could be brusque at times. Management was open about industry headwinds, and smart capital allocation was a priority.

Regardless, shareholder returns have been poor for the past few years. Though SPG weathered e-commerce headwinds as well as any competitor, they are, after all, still a mall REIT.

Management’s demeanor during these difficulties has since changed, culminating with an embarrassing exchange on SPG’s most recent earnings call.

The CEO was asked about the percentage of rent they’ve collected since April, which other US REITs have been disclosing. His response wasn’t exactly helpful:

&gt;**And, look, I will tell you, I mean, we're not giving a percent of what we've collected.** And let me just expand on it for a second if I could. First of all, we're much better than what the prognosticators – I've read some things thinking, well, this is where we're at. We're doing better than that. **But I also don't think it's appropriate to air our discussions in the public format.**  
\[...\]  
**I also want to say the only reason I'm yelling is because I'm far away from the speaker in this social distancing, in our board room, for whatever reason the guy put me away from the speaker**.

CEOs are fighting for their company’s life right now. They may say whatever it takes to access capital. Even those who never misled investors in the past.

Of course, this isn’t just a COVID-19 phenomenon. History is littered with examples of well-respected managers showing their true colors in the face of crisis.

**We all believe we’re excellent judges of character, but if Warren Buffett makes mistakes (*****see:*** [***David Sokol***](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/sokol-resigns-from-berkshire-hathaway/)**), so can the rest of us.**

You already know how seriously to take the word of an E&amp;P or SPAC CEO.

But what will the executive with exemplary behavior during good times do or say when staring down the barrel of a gun?

investing,"I understand all the points of ""Not fighting the Fed"" and all that since the Fed is trying to keep the market up.

But to me it seems like a red flag if the markets have to have this level of intervention to stay up.

I realize the market and the economy are not correlated so I'm not saying this just due to high jobless rates and how poor the economy will likely be for the near term future. But if the market is being pulled down due to securities being overvalued, poor earnings and outlook, and economic tensions; Is it really a benefit to keep trying to pump the market up? Seems to me this is just setting up for a worse situation in the future and a harder rug pull if we do drop.

[**GSX Techedu is a company you should invest in**](https://imgur.com/a/gFOpenm)**.**

This post isn’t really about macroeconomics or the general economy, it’s about a specific company with interesting financials. In mid April, Citron Research and Grizzly Reports published critical reviews of [GSX Techedu](https://www.genshuixue.com/pcweb/#/aboutUs)’s business. Maybe you’ve already read their paper, a few other threads have mentioned the Citron posts but despite Citron claiming to have a ‘smoking gun’ in April, stock hasn’t really been affected nor have I seen a good write up of the summary. So far, it’s just people saying ‘this in the next Luckin!’ and then puts expiring worthless after a month of crabbing share price. Since their releases, Citron has had a couple updates to their evidence and more general news has come out about China’s response to Covid that impacts online education companies. I believe the situation now is more favorable for speculation than it was in April, GSX has posted their quarterly results since then and China is exiting lockdown. First, let’s look at the financials.

*-* [*Quarterly Results*](http://gsx.investorroom.com/2020-05-06-GSX-Announces-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-2020-and-a-Share-Repurchase-Program)*:*

*Net Revenues up by 382.0% Year-Over-Year*

*Gross Billings up by 358.0% Year-Over-Year*

*Net Income up by 336.6% Year-Over-Year*

*Non-GAAP Net Income up by 405.8% Year-Over-Year*

*GSX Techedu's PE Ratio for today is 258.43*

*Current Market Cap: 8.34B*

(GSX) raised $208 million in an IPO on Thursday, June 6th 2019. The company issued 19,800,000 shares at a price of $9.50-$11.50 per share. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank Securities acted as the underwriters for the IPO and Barclays and CLSA were co-managers.

The online teaching industry has certainly been aided by the coronavirus, so if you believe the sole source of the bump is from movement into online classes, know that Beijing is reopening schools in June. Few parents prefer online education to in person classes, I’ve seen both types of classes. If online was preferred, parents had the choice between online and in person before the virus. Nearly all chose in person lessons for their children. Online classes are a bubble, but that’s an industry problem, not one specific to GSX, a tele-teaching service with an 8 billion market cap. Here are eight, kind of nine, points specific to GSX.

**The grizzly/citron criticisms cover a few main points that I’ll summarize, and you can read more about them in the links below.**

**1a. Fake students - non-paying:** ‘[Wuhan and the surrounding area make up almost 50% of the student composition in Q1 2020](https://imgur.com/a/jnHiqEV), which further supports our thesis that a large percentage of revenues are fudged given the large number of free classes offered to students of Wuhan during the Covid-19 crisis and, just as importantly, implies that GSX couldn't have a strong diversified student base to begin with, and that the previous sales revenues are largely exaggerated.’ this is supported by Larry Xiangdong Chen, GSX's founder, Chairman and CEO’s public statement that ""Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have donated RMB20 million worth of regular winter semester courses to Wuhan residents, delivered free courses of all subjects and all grades to tens of millions of students nationwide, and through our Weishi platform, assisted over 134,000 educational institutions and professionals to transfer offline courses to online."". There’s a fair likelihood that students registered under the ‘donation’ are being cited as active customers.  *(for their student location data, note thar Wuhan is in Hubei, the location they’re offering 20 million RMB in free classes).* 

**1b. Fake Students - double booking**: Students of the same unique ID are also being registered to classes of wildly different grade levels. In the links below, the methodologies of student inflation is shown, with many k-12 students registered in multiple different course levels. These are also in the area where millions of dollars in free classes were given out. The revenue is calculated by students in classes, but these are students in the area that are getting free classes and are multi-booked into different class levels. But what if it’s just families using the same ID for all their kids? Remember which country had a single child law.

**2. GSX has potentially fudged their numbers using duplicate classes**: ‘We found out that 24 are free classes (hence excluded), 10 summer classes\* (hence excluded), and 46 programs are duplicates. Effectively, there are only 20 paid programs out of the 100 programs that we’ve initially recorded (100 total - 46 duplicates - 10 summer classes - 24 free classes = 20 paid classes).’

\*Personally, I don’t understand why the summer classes are excluded. Often summer classes in Chinese schools are longer than regular school year lessons and cost somewhat more than normal, so \~30/100 are legit. This also matches up with the revenue claims in **6b**.

**3**. **They’re NOT propped up by the Chinese government**, in fact, they seem to not get along with local officials: ‘Both JiaZhangCun and Parent YouYou are undisclosed related parties of GSX that were founded by members of the Xiong family, who have a well-documented history of defying the Chinese government (e.g., charged with fraud, failure to submit annual filings, cannot be contacted at registered address, altering documents without authorization, business license revoked, etc.)’  There’s also evidence that JiaZhangCun is not currently operational.

**4**. **Numerous shell companies being used to move costs off GSX’s books**: Efforts to trace subsidiaries and co-ownerships resulted in a list of shell companies, some serving as marketing agents for GSX. [I recommend you read more about this here.](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Citron-presents-to-US-regulators-definitive-evidence-of-GSX-Techedu-update.pdf) I feel like this is one of the more interesting sections but in trying to summarize it I can’t do the full story justice.  
●Xiaoyi Jinxiu Curtain Mall: ​the legal representative listed for Xiaoyi Jinxiu Curtain Mall was posting jobs for Gaotu (i.e., GSX), yet the Chinese government’s business registry states that they are in the business of selling window curtains.

●Xiangyang Xiangzhou District Hongshunqi ​Car Mechanics. Their business descriptions on the Chinese government’s business registry are quite peculiar for a company engaging in marketing on behalf of GSX.

●Beijing Youlian

●Beijing Huatongwanjia ​Commerce

●Beijing Prosperity ​Printing

●Zhuhai Jingpo ​Clothing

●Xi'an Beilin District Zhongchangfei ​Baby Products

It’s difficult to say how much of this is normal Chinese-business goofiness. From the Grizzly Research report: ‘GSX also failed to address the main concern that these related parties exist to remove expenses off the company’s books. Instead, they deliberately misconstrued the previous criticisms of Grizzly Research’s and said that “Beijing Youlian transferred its profit to GSX.” Moreover, the company failed to address the job postings that Grizzly Research found which signals that related parties are likely alter egos for GSX, as we have seen in other fraudulent Chinese companies over the years.’

**5.** [**Growth 10x as fast as similar companies**](https://imgur.com/a/GuGdpwh)**:** 

‘The chart (in the link above) showed the 2 years leading up to IPO, this is the completely obscene lie that GSX attempts to tell going forward. This revenue growth chart shows GSX expectations going forward vs. the actual results of EDU, TAL, and Koolearn coming off the same historical revenue base.’ This is the best point in terms of making GSX in particular look fishy. Online education has a fairly low barrier to entry, you could find chinese students to teach english to right now. What makes GSX so much more profitable than its competitors in the field? This trend also began before the virus, so it’s not just a flight to an online alternative.

**6a.** [**GSX's Chinese Official Government Financials Differ from the Ones Filed with the SEC**](https://imgur.com/a/lveSoWq): GSX claims “The gap between the company's credit report and S-1 filing was actually GAAP difference between China and U.S. after the group's restructured to spin-off 2B business in 2017. The difference is totally reasonable and legitimate and has nothing to do with operational numbers.”The link in the 6a header summarizes the breakdown in 2017-2018 sum on credit reports vs what they filed with the SEC. [Further reading.](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GSX-Techedu-The-Most-Blatant-Chinese-Stock-Fraud-Since-2011-ver2.pdf) 

**6b. Additional revenue discrepancies**: ‘The total revenues from the 34,726 unique IDs sum up to around RMB 70.9 million. We then extrapolated the revenues from this sample onto the rest of the remaining untracked classes and have arrived at an estimate of K-12 Q1 2020 revenue of RMB 316 million, which amounts to a 60% discrepancy with reported K- 12 Q4 2019 revenue of RMB 773 million. K-12 revenues make up more than 80% of GSX total revenues.’ Fairly clear cut, Citron’s estimation methods are available more in depth through the 6a link.

**7. Twitter**: CEO Larry made a [GSX twitter this month](https://twitter.com/GSXIR1) to say, “Since the first day of our founding, we have regarded integrity as our core value. We are honest to not only our investors, but also our students and parents, and every employee of the company.” Having experience with private chinese schools myself, this statement is unlikely to be true. You can also note point (**3**) as reason to doubt.

**P/E:** compared to its industry competitors GSX’s price:earnings ratio seems quite high, but actually this is outdated, the below graph has GSX at 186 but it’s risen even higher to 258 as of 5/17/20: [https://imgur.com/a/mbBh1Ap](https://imgur.com/a/mbBh1Ap)

**Summary**: (1) China is likely heading into a recession and has posted their first ever GDP contraction since record keeping began , (2) tele-education is a bubble in china, (3) this company is particularly shady and seems to be cooking the books, and most importantly (4) they’re not too big or connected to fail. 

**Disclaimer**: This is just an accumulation of Citron Research, [Grizzly Reports](https://grizzlyreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Research-Report-GSX-Grizzly-Research-25-Feb-2020.pdf), and publicly available information of GSX’s financials. If you think any of this information may impact the companies long term profitability, remember, stocks only go up. Also, Citron and Grizzly might be wrong, I might not know how to read financial statements, and GSX might be a totally honest company.

I posted this in r/stocks but I thought asking this here would be fitting also. As a general question, I hope people in the future will find answers to this useful.

I'm in high school, and my parents have set up a custodial account for me in E-trade. I trade fairly frequently and sometimes with time-sensitive implications. One significant setback has been the accessibility aspect. I have to go through my parents in order to access my finances (ask if parents are busy, sit down to computer w/ one of them, get them to type in password, etc.). This has been annoying for myself, and as far as I can tell, fairly annoying for them as well. They won't give me the password to the account because it's a custodial account, meaning that under the ""parent"" account are their trading accounts. Understandably, they don't want me to have access to their finances. However, they have said that if I can find a way to independently manage a custodial account separate from theirs, they will give me full access. Do any of you know a way to do this? I have wracked the internet but to no avail.

investing,"In November 1965, the S&amp;P 500 reached a peak. Then for 30 years, the S&amp;P failed to rise above that peak, [adjustted for inflation](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data).

In other words, if you started investing in 1965, your real gains through 1995 would be zero.

I'm wondering how that works in a world in which most people's only retirement plan is based on an assumption of 7% real annual market returns.

Imagine someone who is 35 at the beginning of that bear market. He is reaching his top earning years, so he maxes out his 401k per the best and soundest financial advice any retirement adviser can and should give him. He puts it all into a target date fund, with a retirement target of 1995.

For the next 30 years, these investments will fail to make any real returns. In fact, depending on the exact allocation, they may lose value, specifically the bond portion of his fund holdings. In 1995 the market finally starts to make some real gains, but by this point our subject is very close to retirement, and most of his target-date funds are now in bonds.

Unless I'm missing something, this person, who has prepared for retirement in the best way our society offers, will still fail to retire at 65 after investing in the soundest possible manner for 30 years. The required assumption of the market returning 7% real simply didn't hold for him due to unlucky market timing. His retirement has failed beyond repair.

Am I missing something here?  Or do our policymakers just accept that should another 30-year bear market befall us, then retirement failures on a massive scale will become the new norm?

Or maybe that's why the current policy seems to be avoiding a bear market and pumping up the stock market at any cost - precisely in order to avoid that catastrophic scenario?",How will market-returns-based retirement fare in another 30-year bear market?

I understand the T+2 settlement period and rules that come with it as applies to a cash account... my understanding is that these rules also apply to margin accounts but a margin account will allow you borrow from your brokerage so as to not use unsettled funds and avoid these violations. (1) Is this presumption correct or do these rules simply only apply to cash accounts?

I know I can buy in with the unsettled funds, but I also know that I’m going to sell the same day since I don’t think it’ll sustain this increase. (3) With a cash account, there’s no way to do this without incurring a GFV, right? (4) And in the same scenario with a margin account, how would I go about making this trade without a GFV...

Is this just referencing the price-to-earnings ratio, “market value per share/earnings per share”? Apologies if this is an incredibly obvious question to those in the know, but I didn’t want to make a possibly costly assumption so early in my investing self-education.

investing,"Hi there, I recently stumbled upon this website [https://www.quiverquant.com/sources/senatetrading](https://www.quiverquant.com/sources/senatetrading) which shows the ""trading"" performance of each US senator, most of the time since early 2018. I have noticed something interesting, maybe it is common knowledge in the US , in which case too bad you wasted your time reading this.

Based on the link above, a substantial number of US senators, on both side of the aisle (if that matters), seem to be constantly betting against the US economy. I have reviewed individual graph of each senator and as many as 13 of them have been shorting the market for over 2 years.

As a European, I find it a bit disturbing to be represented by someone who basically makes money every time you don't (i.e. the economy weakens, assuming that stock market performance and global economy are at least loosely correlated). Just to be clear, we are not talking about a simple hedging strategy set up during the crisis, but full-on short strategy since early 2018.

Example (just one among others, I have taken him as his graphs shows a very clear full short strategy): Ted Cruz, who has lost around 40% of his investment between early 2017 and late 2019 (basically the opposite of the market). The only 2 times he has performed well is during 4Q18 (his positions increased by c.25% when the DJIA lost around 18%), and in March this year when his investments doubled (most of his gains have been erased by the subsequent rebound).

I would tend to think that such strategies can lead to conflict of interest, especially when large sums are at play, with senators benefiting from hurting the economy and having interests which are opposed to their constituents'.

Below quoted for some context:

Like many other brokers, Interactive Brokers will route the orders of IBKR Lite clients to market makers in exchange for receiving payment for order flow. Clients that opt to use IBKR Pro will continue to receive the best prices our sophisticated algorithms can secure for them.

“Many brokers sell their clients’ order flow and still charge $4.95 or more to trade stocks and ETFs.

investing,"I'm new to investing and it's my first time doing one of these so go easy. I'm going to try to explain gold price movements post 2008. 

Whenever, gold is ascending, it starts with the fed coming in and lowering the federal funds rate (2019). Bond yields then follow and drop right alongside with funds rate w/ the 10 yr treasury at all time low. Investors start pumping up gold thinking that lower interest rates/QE will cause inflation but CPI is closely tailing behind yields showing that it's deflation. (Confirmed by April's CPI report). graph: [https://imgur.com/gallery/jzDe1Kk](https://imgur.com/gallery/jzDe1Kk) (yes, crayon drawings). 

Banks then start to keep excess reserves to brace for a period of contraction. Graph: [https://imgur.com/gallery/rg8toHP](https://imgur.com/gallery/rg8toHP). Both follow a very similar slope until the excess reserves diverts upwards while gold starts to poop itself. Gold trades sideways when there's more than \~1.6T in reserves. Keeping our reserves high (as banks will however long this crisis takes) keeps the dollar strong and the price of gold down as USD increases purchasing power. 

Gold went on a crazy rally starting in 2009 until 2012 despite the deflation effect of the great recession. This is attributed to the fact that yields rates were too high. The Fed weren't purchasing enough treasuries bc they focused on buying MBS. In this graph, you'll see that whenever the fed increases it's bond purchases, yields are able to be pushed under the CPI which causes gold to drop. graph: [https://imgur.com/gallery/sSWlm02](https://imgur.com/gallery/sSWlm02)

The Federal Reserve released their financial stability report today. Important quotes from the report are listed below:

**Asset Valuations:**

* ""According to data through 2019, farmland prices, both nationally and in several midwestern states, had remained high by historical standards...The effect of COVID-19 on the agricultural supply chain has placed further downward pressure on already-stressed farm income.""
* ""The top 25 hedge funds accounted for 50 percent of the industry’s borrowing as of 2019:Q2, although they accounted for less than 14 percent of its net assets. The increase in leverage concentration has occurred over the past several years as dealers have reportedly given preferential terms to their most-favored hedge fund clients. Market participants have raised concerns over this concentration because distress at a few large hedge funds with disproportionately high leverage can have outsized effects, as they may have to sell large amounts of assets to meet margin calls or reduce portfolio risk during periods of market stress.""

**Borrowing by Businesses and Households:**

* ""The business debt-to- GDP ratio has risen significantly over the past several years, surpassing its historical high . In contrast, the household debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen steadily over the past decade.""
* ""The ratio of debt to assets for all publicly traded non-financial firms was at its highest level in 20 years at the beginning of 2020. Moreover, for highly leveraged public firms— defined as firms above the 75th percentile of the leverage distribution—this indicator is close to a record high.""

* On April 30, Boeing completed the largest bond deal ever not associated with a transaction – they wanted 10 billion, but because there was SO MUCH demand they ended up with a 25 billion issuance, with some bonds that won’t even be redeemed for 40 years at 6%.

TECHNICALS

* Mostly copied from my prior April 10 post: When you look at the 1987, 2002, and 2008-2009 crashes, **whenever the stock market had recovered 50% of the losses,** it was already well on its way to completing the next high of the new bull market. **We have closed** **above 2792.69 on SPX**, and has held solidly. This is clear confirmation that the bottom has already passed.  [https://imgur.com/a/LsHZCpb](https://imgur.com/a/LsHZCpb) 
* And if you also look at the prior crashes, recovery to 50% takes about half the time it took to crash. We fell for six weeks, and now 3 weeks from the march 23 bottom we are already closing in on 50%. It also takes three times the duration of crashing to reach ATH if you look at the prior events- meaning we could be SPX 3300 before September or October. 
* That being said, stocks will remain volatile. No one can predict short term market movements. That’s why I’m staying long, continuing to buy stocks and hedging with trading of short term puts. Based on analysis from Robert Sluymer (at 48 minute mark:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdaJ7OX\_3U&amp;t=48m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdaJ7OX_3U&amp;t=48m)  ) which I am going off of: **anticipate no greater than 10% correction from the \~2950 SPX recent high, so if stocks drop to the 2600s level, I will go all fucking in at buying that dip.**

TAKE AWAY:

* Remember. Stock markets always always always always bottoms out **BEFORE the bad data bottoms out.** Do not look at data today and try to ‘price’ the market at where we are TODAY. Try to price today’s market at what you think it will be in the future. Markets. Are. Forward. Looking.

PELLEY: In the early days of the crisis in this boardroom, you and the committee lowered interest rates essentially to zero. Would you lower them further into negative territory, which the president has suggested is a good idea?

POWELL: So around this table during the last crisis and during the recovery, we looked at negative interest rates. And it's something we decided not to do. We used other tools instead. And those tools involved forward guidance about the federal funds rate and also lots of asset purchases or quantitative easing as it's often referred to.

I continue to think, and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to think that negative interest rates is probably not an appropriate or useful policy for us here in the United States.

PELLEY: And why not? The President seems to think it would help.

POWELL: The evidence on whether it helps is quite mixed. And the issue is people would be depositing money in the bank and that money would be shrinking. They'd be paying interest to put their money in the bank. So it's not a particularly popular policy, as you can imagine.

But in addition, it can also tend to depress the profitability of banks, which makes them likely to lend less, which weighs on economic growth. So I would just say it's not at all settled in, you know, in economic analysis that negative rates really add much value.

PELLEY: I think the idea of negative interest rates is something that a lot of people have a difficult time getting their head around. Would you explain it to me?

POWELL: Well, rather than being paid interest on your cash, you pay interest to the bank -- or if you borrow money, they pay you to borrow money. And if you lend them money by putting it in a bank, then they pay you money.

PELLEY: So the banks would pay people to borrow money, essentially?

POWELL: Yes.

PELLEY: And that would conceivably cause more business and commerce to happen?

POWELL: It would. But, you know, this has been tried. We have negative policy rates in many countries around the world as a result of the financial crisis. And there's no clear finding that it actually does support economic activity on net. And it introduces distortions into the financial system, which I think offset that.

There're plenty of people who think negative interest rates are a good policy. But we don't really think so at the Federal Reserve. And I think it's an area of real uncertainty in the central banking world.
---

I don't quite get what he said here 'Well, rather than being paid interest on your cash, you pay interest to the bank -- or if you borrow money, they pay you to borrow money. And if you lend them money by putting it in a bank, then they pay you money.'

So there are 3 parts here:
1. Rather than being paid interest on your cash, you pay interest to the bank
2. Or if you borrow money, they pay you to borrow money. 
3. And if you lend them money by putting it in a bank, then they pay you money.

So the first 2 parts are coherent in logic, but the third point, if you lend the bank money by putting it in the bank, shouldn't you pay them interest, as suggested by the first 2 points? 

What am i missing here?",Question about Jerome Powell's comment on negative interest rate during CBS interview.

investing,"I know similar questions have been asked a few times, but I have not yet found a rational explanation for why stocks that don't pay dividends are valued so high.

For a company that pays dividends, it is possible to value their shares rationally. If you predict that the company will survive at its current profitability for more than the next 20 years, then a 5+% dividend yield means you expect to make a profit from your investment. If the dividends go up, you expect the share price to rise and vice versa. If the company hits trouble and it looks like it may fail sooner than previously expected, the share price should fall and vice versa. This seems like a fairly simple and rational way of looking at an investment.

However, if you apply the above method to a company like Facebook or Google, you would value their stock as practically worthless. The way I see it, there are two ways a share can return value to its owner;

1. The company distributes profits among its shareholders, either through dividends or a share buyback. Or;
2. The company is wound up and shareholders get a share of the assets.

With regards to point #1, by assigning any value to the shares, you are essentially just betting on the fact that the company will eventually start making dividend payments. With a young, growing company this may be a reasonable assumption. However, what about companies like Facebook?

Point #2 doesn't seem like a very sensible assumption. For example, Facebook's equity in 2019 was $101bn, yet its market cap is over $600bn. Therefore, anyone buying a share in Facebook today would be doing so on the assumption that Facebook's equity has grown by 6x by the time it is eventually wound up. That in itself opens up another question - why would a company choose to liquidate with $600bn of equity? Surely it would make more sense to use some of this equity to keep the company operating?

I get the idea of reinvesting profits for growth and I agree that for a young and growing company, this strategy makes the most sense. However, this growth is worthless if there is not eventually some form of repayment to the shareholders.",Why are stocks that don't pay dividends so valuable?

investing,"For those fundamental investors like me who like to invest in companies that are undervalued, it can be helpful to consider a company's valuation based on its discounted cash flow (DCF).

Essentially, I consider a company's discounted cash flow based on its 10-year projected operating cash flow (also called cash flow from operations) and your preferred discount rate.

I created a spreadsheet that can calculate for you the intrinsic price per share of a company's stock based on its operating cash flow and the discount rate. It also calculates the discount of the stock price relative to this intrinsic value.

To use it, simply [download the spreadsheet here](https://gofile.io/d/5rgEot). It is available in ODS (OpenDocument) format because I hate proprietary formats, and it should be usable in Excel, etc. Once you download it, simply fill in the boxes in with red labels based on the company's financial statements. You can find these values on SEC EDGAR or simply by looking on Yahoo Finance. You should also fill in the discount rate and the company's projected growth rates based on your assumptions, but analyst opinions can sometimes help with this.

One thing I like about my spreadsheet is it will calculate the company's intrinsic stock price based on these projected cash flows and tell you whether or not a company is over- or under-valued at its current market price, as well as the percentage discount (on my spreadsheet, a positive discount represents that the current price is trading at less than its intrinsic value).

I hope this helps everyone!",I made a spreadsheet to value a stock based on discounted cash flow...

https://zeihan.com/a-failure-of-leadership-part-iii-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-china/

Author background from Wikipedia:

&gt;Peter Zeihan is a geopolitical strategist, author, and speaker who specializes in global energy, demographics and security. He analyzes the realities of geography and populations to deepen the understanding of how global politics impact markets and economic trends.

I'm the article Zeihan describes a situation in China where:

&gt;The only short-term patch is to quadruple down on the long-term debt-debt-debt strategy that the CCP already knows no longer works, a strategy it has already followed more aggressively and for longer than any country previous, both in absolute and relative terms. The top tier of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) – and most certainly Xi himself – realize that means China’s inevitable “correction” will be far worse than anything that has happened in any recessionary period anywhere in the world in the past several decades.

I find the analysis before this point interesting. He states the debt to GDP is well over 150% and how the growth of debt is far outpacing the growth of GDP. 

It got me wondering about 1) How accurate his analysis is. And 2) Why the current lack of exports would necessarily trigger the debt problems. If they can't export at a high level, does that mean the current rate of 0 interest loans would materialize in a higher rate of inflation? Is it inflation that would stop them from continuing to just issue more and more debt?",Zeihan Predicts Coronavirus Backlash is the Beginning of a Looming Debt Crisis for China

The author recommends to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) and states that when you can live off the dividends VTSAX provides, you are financially free. Does anyone here do this? Do you think the author here is specifically talking about a taxable brokerage account that isn't a Roth IRA? If so, how much would someone realistically need in their account to be receiving enough dividends to essentially live off of (I know location and lifestyle are a huge factor)? Even with $25k in my Roth IRA I'll only see an extra hundred dollars or so pop up in dividends every now and then, so I can't even fathom what this author is referring to.

investing,"To caveat all of this, I understand that most of the job losses from the BLS reports are furloughs and therefore may be temporary.  I accounted for that in the below:

1. Since the week of March 21st, we have lost 36.5 million jobs
2. Job loss has been decelerating at an average rate of 13% per week.  The week ended in May 9th resulted in 3 million new job losses
3. Jay Powell has said he expects unemployment to top out ""one or two months"" from May 14th - so let's say end of June (6 weeks)
4. If we continue to sustain job losses that fall at a rate of 13% for 6 more weeks, we will be at 45 million losses by the end of June (these numbers line up with a recent prediction by Goldman that we will reach 25% unemployment)
5. During the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) we lost 8.8 million jobs.  It took 6.5 years to recoup all those jobs, at an average rate of 1.35 million jobs per year
6. If we recoup jobs at the same rate as we did during the GFC, it will take over 33 years to get back to 2019 levels of employment (or until 2053)
7. Let's assume though that 60% of those jobs come back immediately.  About 75% of job losses are furloughs, but I'm assuming that 15% of those won't come back because businesses will want to lean down and the economy will be less strong
8. That leaves 18 million jobs truly lost (45M \* 40%).  If we recoup those at the rate of 1.35 million per year, it will take us 13 years to recover them all (until 2033).

Can someone explain to me why I'm wrong? If anything, I think those numbers are conservative.  If we don't get a vaccine for 18-24 months, I don't think we will recover jobs as quickly as we did during the GFC.

2. Real estate in rural, even semi-rural places is dirt cheap. Whether you wanna save like crazy and buy a little $80k ranch or if you wanna buy your dream home for $300k, it's extremely cheap. Naturally, these undervalued assets will increase in price as the location drawbacks decrease. You might say ""no one wants to live a half hour from a gas station or supermarket"". I get that, but I'm not talking about the middle of nowhere. There are places that are semi-rural/suburban that are still dirt cheap.

3. City real estate is in bubble territory. People are going to start realizing that paying $2,500/month for a studio apartment in NYC is stupid. People justify it nowadays because of job opportunities. But when they realize they can get a job that's based out of NYC but live in the Adirondacks or the Poconos for a 1/4 of the price, they're going to start doing that.

investing,"The argument for buying gold is all about inflation.  Central banks globally are printing money, leading to debasement of their currencies, which will drive investors into ""hard assets"" like gold.  Gold is up about 30% since the beginning of 2019 - is now a good time to buy?

Here are my concerns with what these guys are saying:

1. Inflation isn't just about central bank activity.  There are now massive deflationary pressures from COVID that will most likely counteract anything that central banks do.
2. Gold has become a consensus view in the investment world over the past two months.  If everyone is all in, that leaves room for a significant technical correction.
3. Gold tends to be used as collateral in institutional finance, so when markets go through a downturn big funds are forced to sell to make margin calls (s.c Bridgewater in March). 

My biggest concern is that gold bugs have been talking about inflation for 30 years and it hasn't happened.  People were wrong about it in 2009, but it goes back way before that.

•How much more market share is there for Spotify? Revenue went from $2bn to roughly $7bn in 5 years and yet they still can’t generate a consistent profit margin. They control about 35-40% of the market already and many say there is still room to grow but it’s going to be challenging with Apple, Google, Amazon also fighting for control. Additionally, revenue streaming growth across the industry is expected to decline in the 2020’s.


• Yes, Spotify was “profitable” for Q1 by that was largely because they have a ton of warrants marked at fair value which led to a $70mm increase in “finance income”. It can have an impact of $50-100mm depending on moves in share price.

Hi,

I'm beginning my penny stock journey and currently building stats and a playbook based on manual backtesting. Anyone interested to collaborate on research and share notes?

**I'm looking for traders who are:**

* Motivated, doing this full time or at least 4 hours a day.
* Experienced, has read and learned enough that you don't require much elaboration on new concepts
* Disciplined to be able to commit and deliver a certain amount of output each week.

**About my experience:**

I've day traded for a year in 2007 and wasn't really able to make anything of it. Found out it was not for me. Been learning forex the past 2 years and finally been profitable to make my living off of it the past few months, solely from trading EURUSD.

I have a programming background but has since retired from coding. I know technical analysis and how to use it properly. Some fundamental analysis but dont need to use it for this purpose. I also know that risk management is paramount in this business and I'm that point where I'm confident of my ability to make money in the markets no matter what.

I'm diving into the penny stock arena because it provides a very good way to make another stream of trading income that is uncorrelated.

My preferred method is to swing these pennies for 1 day to 1 week and use intraday patterns for tighter entries and better risk reward.

I research and backtest by going through each breakout in each ticker one by one for the past X years, saving those intraday patterns in a Google Doc. I also note down statistics related to each breakout in a Google Sheet.

I need help in building this database to gain confidence in the patterns and therefore build an edge. There are a lot of tickers and by dividing the work we can get there 10x faster and share the results among ourselves.

Is this inflation going to eventually going to filter out? What is going to happen once quantitative easing ends, but we have wall street swollen with printed money?

investing,"Given that retail stores have been completely beaten up with the Coronavirus pandemic, and that small caps are way riskier, one cannot obviously disregard that current times are presenting huge investment oportunities, given that companies are trading at prices below their ""fair value"".

* Retail
* Real estate
* Oil exploration

where in some cases, prices are below book value. I'm putting small amounts on some of these sectors, with the hope the high upside in any of them may compensate the failure of some of them. I'm trying to see if it makes some sense to bet on Taylored Brands. 

My points in favor are:

* They're trading at all time lows.
* Stores are starting to [reopen stores](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200507005960/en/Tailored-Brands-Announces-Phased-Store-Reopening-Plans), which are mostly on Texas, that is gradually reopening the economy.
* Their products are more targeted to high-end demand, whose income is likely to be less impacted by a recession.
* They survived the last recession.
* In their last 10k, they indicate that most of their debts mature in 1+ years
* Michael Burry keeps a good position

Points against:

* Covid may significantly reduce in-store purchases.
* Their seasonal income coming from weddings and such events will not return, at best until next year.
* They're still very indebted.
* Management hasn't put a single dime to buy this dip.

investing,"I've been thinking about WTI contracts for oil (CLK20) going to zero and how this month contract is going to be settled on tuesday.

We have seen price plunge from around 22 USD for contract to negative in one day and bounce back to around 10 USD in the next day.

The biggest plunge happened around 2pm ET the day before the contract ended. I'm wondering why it happened at that time?

For instance my broker (IB) have futures cut off date where the long and short positions are closed at the same time which is one day before contract settlement ( i think this have something to do with not being liable for delivery) which is 9am ET on may 18th for CLM20 (June contract).

Lets go back to the CLK20 contract. Settlement was due on 21st April. The plunge started around noon. I'm not sure if cutoff date was implemented by brokers earlier, but if it was then most of retail was already out of the contract and they would not be affected by the price movement on that date. Also they would not be able to initiate new positions after that- so no buying, but also no short selling. But Im not sure if this was implemented or is it only my broker that implemented such a forced close out policy after April negative prices.

Lets say there are brokers that still allow holding futures till the end - until delivery date, and do not automatically force to close out positions. This means that all long and short position will automatically close out at the same time. If there are more long positions than short I think we might be seeing quite huge drop at around 9am ET on Monday. However if the are more shorts then there would be not enough people selling oil contracts for short sellers to safely close their positions. We might be seeing prices going up at that time.

Lastly im not sure if the oil prices can go to negative again this month. Even though the situation with storage is similar- it is booked quite fully and last weeks only resulted in additional barrels. There are some measures put in place to protect investors from what happened last month. It might be a once in a lifetime situation with prices going below zero. A drop might be possible since the future price went up pretty fast and we dont know spot prices yet.

investing,"Hi!

I’m a pretty novice investor who isn’t classically trained in economics. I have a few questions that may or may not be a good strategy and would be interested in feedback! 

If your sole goal was to make passive income via stock dividends, wouldn’t it make sense to trigger as many ex-dividend counts as possible to collect the most dividends possible?

If the “time value of money” has a cost, why diversify your capital into different stocks that you hold over time which only pay out 4 times a year (if you are lucky), when you could focus that capital in one or two places in big bursts where you can have as many shares possible to capture the most dividend payments?

How it would work:

1) Build an excel/google doc with a list of dividend paying stocks (primarily aristocrats but hopefully enough to fill a calendar), arrange them by their future ex-dividend date in chronological order. 

2) A few days before each of these dividend stock’s ex-Dividend Date, you move your capital into the stock to be counted to collect the cash dividend. 

3) The next market open you sell back into cash before moving all in to the next dividend stock on your list before their up coming ex-dividend date.  

You just keep looping the money into the stock, get counted receive the cash dividend, and repeat. You just cannon blast your capital into each stock to acquire the maximum number of shares possible for each ex-dividend date count while reducing the amount of time you actually own the stock. 

The alternative (classic dividend long term investment method) of spreading your money out over many stocks, waiting months for each dividend payment to pay out while your capital is idle, means you can’t pool all of your capital in one place to maximize the size of each ex-dividend count.

What am I missing? Wouldn't it be better to just funnel a large chunk of money into the current ex-dividend dated stock the day before, instead of spreading the money out among many dividend paying stocks where the money has fewer shares allocated in each stock while the ex-dividend date is not being recorded?

Thanks!",Free Money looping Ex-Dividend date Stocks?

Its stock shot from $22 to $197 since mid-March, before settling back to a recent $175. Before lockdowns shuttered most of Wayfair's competition and trapped Americans in front of their computer screens, the Boston-based company was a fast-growing but cash-consuming e-commerce pioneer that few expected to reach anyone's definition of profitability before 2022.

Most analysts expect Wayfair's sales spurt will then subside and return the company to its cash-consuming ways for another year at least.

Wayfair's sales multiple is smaller than rivals like Amazon, but most big e-commerce firms have real cash flow.

A return to Wayfair's average price of 0.9-times forward sales would drop the stock 25%. Even a longtime bull like Oliver Wintermantel at Evercore ISI decided that the stock's recent nine-fold rise left little upside.

Wayfair is one of the easiest places to shop for furniture and home goods, with five distinctly-branded websites that offer 18 million products from thousands of suppliers.

From early 2019 to mid-March 2020, Wayfair stock sank from $170 to $22. Bowing to the stock market voting machine, Shah vowed to improve Wayfair's efficiency and-on the call discussing year-end 2019 results-announced plans to lay off 550 people from headquarters.

Who cares if people are visiting retailers when COVID is nowhere close to being stamped out? Won’t a reversion to historical economic activity simply drive more COVID cases?

Now visits are on a trajectory back to (35%) YoY and... we expect COVID cases to continue to decline. OK...

I was devastated when the account showed that I only had $1000 to trade with. I went ahead and put it into $SRNE, and proceeded to call Chase customer service for an answer: I was put on hold indefinitely. Then, $SRNE started mooning! So, around 12:27PM, when $SRNE was well above $8.50, I proceeded to TRY to set a Stop loss at $8 for all my $SRNE shares. Chase YouInvest kept blocking my stop loss, saying it was an ""Invalid Stop Loss"".  This kept going on no matter what price I put in, and eventually $SRNE started coming down, and I eventually was able to Limit sell for $6.94 for a total of $1387.

2. It is good and stock price should be way more than $100 bec. typical profitable companies should do like 10% of stock price to be the EPS...",How does EPS correlate with Stock price?

investing,"I was looking for stocks with a low PE ratio to start filtering and I found Allianz (ALV.DE), I still have to finish my research, I'm now reading the annual report, but my superficial thoughts are that even if the stock price doesn't grow at all, it still has a good 6% dividend since the stock tanked, with a good underlying business to back it up.

I think insurance companies are cool because they're like a casino, they're based on statistics and put the odds in their favour.
They also have an asset management branch but I dont know much about it.

They may have a bad year bc of the coronavirus and people receiving payments and then less earnings for 1 or 2 years because less people are buying insurance because of money problems.

investing,"Why am I writing this?
Well first, as you all should know, my ideas are important. Next, I appreciate analysts who can dissect financial statements and find that edge that only workaholic investment banker could, but how am I supposed to know whether or not the analysis is any good? Do I just trust analyst? And if I did, then why doesn't he just send out his portfolio and I match that? Funny how analysts and banks that cover companies never divulge what they actually hold. And for that reason, I'll never fully trust them enough to trust their analysis.

Here's the deal. I've done some reading about OneConnect Financial, and I like it. I also bought it. Here's why:

Words of Wisdom: if you like something, find the thing that made the thing.

So if you think an industry will experience rapid growth, go figure out what powers that industry. Then, find out what powers that. Buy that. There will be a lot of firms at the edge of innovation, but they will all get their core resources from somewhere.

Ok, OneConnect Financial. These guys are a Chinese company that somehow managed to get listed on the NYSE. They call themselves a 'technology as a service' platform for financial institutions in China. All of China's top lenders use their technology for, well, something, and so do 99% of the tier down. According to them, they service things like channel sales, product, risk management, services and operations. They've got all the right buzzwords such as AI, blockchain and big data. Basically if you are a financial institution in China and looking to go paperless and online, this is your first stop, after the government of course. They're growing and they are expanding in to Asia.

Here's what I'm most excited about. China is investing heavily in an alternative to SWIFT. In short, SWIFT is a 'society' (hence the S) that provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions. Basically if you've ever had to send an international wire, maybe to some shady-ass 'services' company in Mexico for spring break, you sent a SWIFT transfer. It probably cost like $30 and took 2-5 days. The key thing here is they send 'information'. The 'information' usually passes through multiple banks, sometimes obfuscating how much money is actually included in the transfer. It accomplishes security through obscurity and is seriously outdated US tech. Believe it or not, US finance doesn't like change!

The inefficiencies in SWIFT is one of the main reasons why people were so excited about crypto. Ripple was specifically designed for interbank transfers that are fast, secure, and cost the mining fee to verify the transaction (so less than $1). The Chinese want something better. Alibaba and Tencent have already built parallel banking systems and we are all increasingly using digital wallets. The US has fallen behind, drastically.

I could use this paragraph to give a bunch of stats about how Asian point of sales cash purchases are projected to fall by half by 2023 and last year mobile payments in Chinese customers paid $49tr in mobile purchases, up 35x from 2013, but what does any of that even mean. The point is the opportunity is huge. Some Chinese fintech firms will fail, some will succeed. I'll make the bet on the software that powers these Chinese tech firms. Also, they were spawned off by Ping An, a $1tr Chinese insurer. These guys have spun off 35 companies and invest $160bn every year in R&amp;D. Its no mistake OneConnect is positioned to win.

So all that's great, but how do we know there is value (and really, still, what do they do?). They listed on the NYSE last December with analysts projecting 70% growth in a year. Today, they have a market cap of $5bn. To me, that feels low. Their net margin is -71%, but I really don't have the time to figure out exactly how much of that is spent on future product or supporting existing customers. I'm assuming it's a tech company looking for massive growth. And that's the bet I'm making. I only own a little now, but I'm looking to add to the position as I free up some other short term plays (like my SPY puts) and the market, well, looks a lot different than it does now. If it pops, I'll buy, because, well, FOMO.",OCFT - Why I'm bullish (and bought)

The title can come off a bit cringe, but take a listen as the content is quite good. The [podcast website is available here](http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/). The things I like about it are:  

* Balance between overview and depth
  * I'm not looking for discussions of specific stocks or which index fund to use for my 401K, etc. The interviewees are all experts in their domain and Patrick finds the sweet spot between discussing their area in general and relating it to recent events.
* Topics
  * There's certainly variety, but I am personally quite interested in tech, business, venture capital, investing, .. which overlaps very well with his content.
* Timeliness
  * There's a good balance between recent events (EG oil price crash last month) and longer term trends in a particular topic area. Even if it is recent, they connect to larger trends. 
* Patrick's interview style
  * The guests get most of the speaking time in an episode and while Patrick joins in, his questions are always on point and seamlessly drive the episodes forward. 
* Weekly episodes of about an hour
  * This isn't a big thing, but I'd rather listen to something higher quality that's able to get deeper than a 15 minute chat put out daily.
* Worldwide focus
  * I find many financial podcasts are US focused, however the topics and discussions here are either worldly or can be applied anywhere.

So for IVR for example, the Jan 2021 $2 call is basically $115. I expect REITs to bump at some point and buy these at a fraction of their future price when exercised.

It seemed like he took our advice! On Friday (5/15/2020) Ackman reported a new 678,000 share position in PK. Take a look at our post and see why we believe in PK. Disclosure - we have positions in PK, starting mid-March 2020.

\--- 

PK is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that holds the real estate property that HLT uses. PK was spun out to make HLT an asset-light company. According to HLT's 2019 annual report, it only owned $380M in property.

We believe PK is a significantly better buy than HLT for the following reasons:

1. **PK is currently valued at $1.8B while its real estate value minus all liabilities equal $5B.** There is a significant discrepancy between PK's market value and the intrinsic value of the real estate it holds. On the other hand, HLT is valued at $17B. However, HLT holds $10B in goodwill and brand value on its balance sheet. PK is a better buy because it holds more real value than HLT.
2. **PK is currently 77% down from its 52-week high compared to HLT which is 45% down from its 52-week high.** PK is a better buy because it has significantly higher upside than HLT.
3. **PK historically pays $0.43 - $1.00 per share in dividends compared to HLT which historically pays $0.07 - $0.15 per share.** HLT has suspended dividend payments while PK has not definitively suspended dividend payments yet.
4. **PK currently has $4.8B in liabilities while HLT has $15.5B in liabilities.** PK is well able to cover its liabilities with $11B in assets while HLT cannot cover its liabilities with $15B in assets.

In summary, both PK and HLT have &gt;$1B in cash on hand or option to withdraw from their revolving credit facility and will likely be able to survive the COVID-19 crisis. However, PK is a much better investment than HLT for those interested in playing the upside in the hospitality industry.

(Note, i actually went back and deleted a solid majority the DD in the post weeks later out of frustration with responses from this community &amp; the repeated inability to discuss an analysis with critiques; its as if each of my posts are plagued by elitist comments spamming “don’t quit your day job."")  Each time without properly critiquing the analysis or play I’ve set forth at all.

This post is as a wake up call to the community... Why on earth does it seem that no one can ever present a comment in form of a critique or as a way to spark further discussion; rather than as a way to assert “actually you didn’t think of ‘this’, idiot you’re wrong.” We all will make more money by being level headed &amp; presenting data with a rational analysis rather than stubborn assholes with a 'crystal ball projection' while totally throwing fundamentals+technical's out the window to front run the current federal intervention/support.

Mini-rant done.. Now to talk about how I had highlighted on Mar 16th that gold/gold miners were unjustifiably sold off that week before, &amp; pointed out that considering the economic environment which we faced moving forward they could've very likely bottomed quickly &amp; began their rebound in that week.. 

The first half of my post was explaining how I believed the recovery of this crash would effectively play out as a transferring wealth in the markets, also made note that DXY was extremely over-extended &amp; investors would have to shift money into one asset or another soon enough.. welp, go figure that asset was [gold](https://gyazo.com/8a0aab6b856802f78444379e6e0dd726). (From the time the post was made Gold is trading 22% higher; while it's rebounded just as much as the markets have, it's done so without any needed of intervention from our government....) 

I had only been trading for about a month at the time of the post and wasn’t at all aware of or by any means up to speed with options trading (considering each week I was learning A FUCK LOAD more and more); now only if someone had taken a second to humor the post in the moment like “oh shit, this kid might be onto something; yo fuck JNUG or NUGT, we should all be buying leap calls on GDX or GLD”... We could all be millionaires right now lol... Those option contracts have gone THRU THE ROOF; since gold is realistically undervalued/cheap right now relative to the inflation which we’ve seen across all other assets since 2009. I believe we could see gold break 2K by fall &amp; be pushing 3k early 2021.

&gt; Schnur said the extra costs go beyond stepped up cleaning and safety equipment and includes “significant increases in supply chain and logistics costs as we work to get our materials to those who have the greatest need.”

&gt; Another company facing added costs is Calumet Electronics Corp., in Calumet, Mich., which said it has spent $80,000 on everything from soap to mobile desks to keep workers safe through the crisis. 

&gt; For Emerald, orders surged 150% in March and were up another 7% in April. But there’s a dark side to that surge, both in terms of cost and complexity.

&gt; All the steps the company has taken — both to boost output and keep workers safe — are expected to add at least $350,000 to costs by the end of the year. This doesn’t include the lost production time, which adds up to at least an hour each day, that machines have to be shut down for cleaning. Kelly, Emerald’s chief executive officer, said he hasn’t figured out what this will do to his profits, but he expects a big hit to his margins. Emerald is a family-owned business with annual sales of about $85 million. 

...

&gt; Even the company’s rag bill exploded. They used to buy 2,000 rags a week. Now it’s 7,000. The cost of that one item has jumped from $300 a month to $1,000, while disposable glove use has tripled.

&gt; Michael Rincon, Emerald’s director of operations, says each week brings new twists. For instance, they’ve discovered that having workers constantly wiping surfaces with isopropyl alcohol erodes signs and buttons — but they only realized that after it was too late. On one machine in the factory, the word “danger” printed in bright red has blurred. 

...

&gt; Kelly said he even thought about trying to put through a price increase to offset some of these expenses. But a few weeks ago, his biggest customer let him know that was a non-starter. The customer told Kelly he was going to see who else might be able to supply him with produce bags, presumably at a better price. 

...

&gt; “The toughest thing is that there isn’t much direction from the state or the federal government,” Pallavi Joyappa, Emerald’s chief operating officer, said. “You are kind of making it up as you go along.” 

TL;DR: Some businesses' orders bloom, but their total profit at the end may stagnate or even go down due to supply chain disruptions and needing additional PPE/cleaning to maintain operations.

investing,"Hi all, thought I'd try to put down in some thoughts on why I think Sundance Energy is a great undervalued stock.

Caveat, I'm new to this game, so this is almost to convince myself that the shares I bought at 3 dollars are still worth it. They are, IMHO. 

Sundance is an Oil and Natural gas company. Obviously if you think Oil is going to Contango again, this is a bad pick. However if you are thinking it's not and it continues to rally, then this might be a bad time to get in on the action.

https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Relentless-Oil-Price-Rally.html

OK so if Oil, then why Sundance?

What caught my attention to them was a rally around March, they went from 1 dollar to 3 and have hung right at 2.50 through 3 dollars a share for the past month with a small spike to a bit above 4 dollars. So I figured that based upon what everyone else was doing with this stock, this is probably close to the bottom, pending they don't go out of business. It's at this point that I thought it deserved a closer look. 

I've read their latest financial reporting, and have seen the last few have very clearly stated,

The current outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations and is likely to have a continuing adverse impact for a significant period of time.

Umm no shit. That's the enitre enterprise. OK so they are little and vulnerable. Will they go under?They do state this;

As a result of the decline in commodity prices since December 31, 2019, we expect our 2020 capital program to be in the range of $40 - $45 million.  However, we plan to respond flexibly to market conditions to protect our balance sheet and retain liquidity. We believe that our cash flow generated from operating activities (which includes proceeds from settlements of hedging contracts) and cash on hand at December 31, 2019 will be sufficient to execute this plan.

Also worth noting their debt doesn't mature until 2022.

Reading above, What hedging contracts do you ask?

For the balance of 2020 from April through December, Sundance has hedges in place covering a total of 7,931 barrels of
crude oil per day (or 2,181,000 barrels total) at a weighted average floor price of $54.08 per barrel. For the calendar year
2021, Sundance has hedges in place covering a total of 7,430 barrels of crude oil per day (or 2,712,000 barrels total) at a
weighted average floor price of $48.92 per barrel. In total, Sundance has 5,581,000 barrels of crude oil hedged through
2023. In 2020 Sundance has 225,000 barrels subject to an initial $50.00 floor price and a $35.00 reparticipating floor price
and 18,000 barrels subject to an initial $55.00 floor price and a $30.00 reparticipating floor price. In 2021 Sundance has
300,000 barrels subject to an initial $50.00 floor price and a $35.00 reparticipating floor price.

For the full report on hedges because it's important... 
https://sundance.irpass.com/profiles/investor/PDFview.aspx?b=2370&amp;ID=92249&amp;m=rl&amp;g=1186

Also worth noting their whole thing is low oil costs they can still break even on wells. 

Low break even costs on wells is another asset for this company. Pulled the below from their Feb presentation. 

Deep inventory of wells with full-cycle break even costs of ~$30.00 per boe allows 
Sundance to deliver production and EBITDA growth under various oil price scenarios. 

Given all this, I expect a bumpy ride over the next year, but a pretty big payoff once we get out of this mess. And hey, who knows, maybe because everyone expects Oil to fall it will continue to rally. It is 2020 after all. Who thought we would be here a year ago? Is 70 dollar oil out of the question?

I am 26 years old. Full-Time gigging musician (Except during quarantine).

I have multiple income streams some in cash, some with I-9, some with w2.

This all means that:

1) Although I make more than enough to live+save+potentially build wealth, I have no employer 401k.

2) With taxable income being only a fraction of my total income, I am at a lower tax bracket.

3) My income is very variable. Overall, I am increasing my business as a musician every year. But some seasons are worse than others. (For example, I am barely making any money during this pandemic) This makes a ""dollar cost averaging"" sort of investment strategy difficult at times to stick to.

4) As a freelancer, I have a larger emergency fund than most salaried workers comparable to my living style. This decision is currently proving to have been a good decision.

5) I am now looking to create a larger plan for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to start building wealth and start investing, but everywhere I look (this subreddit, r/personalfinance, youtube, books) I still don't seem to have a clear path for someone like me.

&amp;#x200B;

# The thing is, I don't really want to retire at 65 or ever.

I am a musician, and pretty much would love to keep performing until I die.

I understand the tax benefits of opening an IRA or RothIRA. (As my current tax bracket is super low, I was considering the RothIRA.)

But should I really think about locking up all my investments until 65?

Can't I still withdraw my principle from a RothIRA before 65? Should I just do this?

Should I just open an non-tax-advantaged account and start investing?

Should I do a little bit of both?

Does the ""set aside 15-20% income for retirement"" thing apply to me if I don't want to retire? If not, how do I decide how much to invest?

I have never posted here and only am doing so because I’ve been telling myself for a long time that I would promote this stock when the time has come and I believe now is the best time to bring everything I know to the table for those who like a *riskier but good bet.*

 I have been invested in Zest since 2017. Between myself and reach of acquaintances we have just shy of 1 million shares (this is between several people that all own their own shares). So yes I may come off as a “promoter” myself or that I’m just looking to pump this for a short period. Yes my goal here is to make money on my investment but I have obviously been invested in this for a long time and believe it could be a great opportunity.

ZEST:

Zest is traded on the OTCGB market and most people I know use E*TRADE to trade it. Zest has been around for years and patented a technology / device that is placed with fresh produce from the farmer to the grocery store. This device can read information about the produce and maximize the efficiency of the supply chain. It is a product that guarantees a cost savings for major grocers. In addition, Zest has bought out several companies including a recent Oil/Gas company called Banner Midstream. This is important later but for now just think of zest as its original product/tech company but also a holding company. Sources say they did this to support their cash flow as energy typically does. 

In early 2018 Zest entered an agreement with Costco and Walmart. After a short period Walmart cancelled their agreement and launched their own version of this technology and named it Eden Technology. We were baffled when we saw this. As investors, we were thinking WTF?! Did they buy zest or what?! Well shortly after Zest filed a Lawsuit seeking 2 billion from Walmart. We have been following the court filing ever since in which the court trial date was set for June 6, 2020. During this time we saw zest fall from $2.00 to lows of $0.45. 

Throughout the past 2 years we have discussed what a settlement would look like and when it might occur. We have seen several ideas thrown around through court filings that would lead you to believe the case is going well for Zest. I’d say the biggest red flag was our research about the law firms on behalf of zest. They take large, highly probable cases. One player came in later than particular grabbed our attention that we certainly know would take on the real deal. 

Fast forward to the beginning to mid last week/beginning of this week - an 8-K filing was posted that urged Banner Midstream to finalize conversion to Zest shares. Also, warrants that were issued last year to be exercised into shares. Without going into to much detail it could be suggested that Zest wants to owe less shares through their various agreements because the share price is going to go up soon. We have seen the share price go from .60 to 1.5 and settling back around 1.2 during this time. Then, on Wednesday we see on the court filings that the pre-trial was cancelled. Through our research with law friends, it is strongly suggested that this would be because of a settlement. With the pre-trial being scheduled and canceled on May 21st and the trial date on June 6th, we are more confident than ever that a settlement was made.

We have heard several numbers thrown around including some that the settlement could be more than double the original amount (which was $2 Billion). But we don’t really know. What we do know is that if a settlement was made for anything close to the $2 billion that the shares would be worth anywhere between $15 - $75 per share. This is obviously speculative, hopes, and wishes, but it is definitely possible.

investing,"So I am writing this post partially to inform people about a potentially great buy and partially for feedback as to whether I'm missing something. The oil tanker (meaning they store and ship oil) Euronav is currently trading for near the price that they were in Q1 of 2019, even thought their profits are about 10 times higher Q1 of 2020. They have announced a dividend for Q1 of 2020 of $1.10, which would make their dividend yield 33%(!!!) if they continued it throughout the year.  While they almost undoubtedly won't continue to have the massive increase in earnings once the oil market normalizes, they were profitable before and are very profitable for the time being. They also have very little debt and a relatively new fleet compared to the rest of the industry.  


They seem committed to giving back capital to shareholders, and although their headquartering in Belgium means that you may have international taxes withheld from dividend payouts they are currently offering an absurdly large yield.

The 4 year old is on the spectrum (asd) and has a 529, however, not sure if I will switch to ABLE or use for the younger children. Point is, I want a more flexible investment vehicle for all my children and I believe a custodial Roth IRA is that choice.

* Company Name
* Current Price
* Daily Change $/%, Weekly Change, YTD Change
* Currency
* Market Cap ($Bi)
* PE Ratio

* Gross Margin, Profit Margin
* Dividend per Share, Dividend Yield, Dividend Payout %
* Debt/Equity Ratio, Current Ratio, Price to Book Value Ratio
* 52-week High, 52-week Low

If someone finds it necessary, I can update it to display data in USD, since most data in the worksheet is already in EUR and USD.

There's also a feature to compare the price evolution of 2 stocks in a chart over an adjustable period of time and you can check a list of Dividend Kings, which I thought would be cool if you're a dividend investor.

investing,"After catching up on Buffett dropping all airline stocks last week, I decided to do a deeper dive into the airline industry.

After all, whether with or without a crystal ball, one thing is for certain: In a normal world, we need airlines in order to function properly, not only as an economy, but as a civilization.

Which means sooner or later, airlines will be running again (or flying I suppose).

Given that airline stocks have had such a huge beat down, I decided to analyze the ones that Buffett dumped. 

For one reason or another, they were once investable in his eyes, but now not anymore.

* American Airlines (AAL)
* Delta Airlines (DAL)
* Southwest Airlines (LUV)
* United Airlines (UAL)


Let me begin by saying that I’ve always had a bias towards Southwest Airlines. I was even invested in them ever since $18 and stuck them in my dividend growth portfolio. Their company has a great, economy-class flights, that’s very reasonable and affordable. Every flight I’ve been on is almost always full (note: anecdotal bias). 

Below are some numbers I pulled and calculated from Yahoo! Finance:

https://imgur.com/gallery/001C5rb

With that said, as you can see from the numbers above, Southwest Airlines is positioned better in terms of *liquidity* and *solvency* in relation to its other three peers.

They have the highest liquidity ratios indicating that they have sufficient cash set aside to cover their outstanding debt and interest payments in the near term.

Additionally, their interest coverage ratio is 28.22, which far exceeds the other 3 airlines, indicating that they could cover the next 28 interest loan payments at their current state. As such, they’re the only company that does not need a bail out.

Their debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios are also lower indicating a lower use of leverage and borrowings.

**Dividends**

Of the four airline companies, only three has historically paid dividends: American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines.

However, amidst this pandemic, Delta has decided to suspend dividend payments.

AAL has a history of paying a dividend of $0.10 per share, with the last payment back in February.

LUV has been paying $0.18 per share recently, with the last payment back in March.

Dividend payments can be a good signal of cash flow strength (or weakness). Given that AAL and LUV are still paying dividends, they’re probably in a better liquidity situation. 

**Southwest Still Has Huge Risks**

Given these numbers, it’s clear that Southwest is in a better position than the other airlines on paper. We’re still unsure whether there’ll be a full bailout of these airlines.

However, I would be very cautious with Southwest for the time being.

They have a huge risk right now, and that Southwest operates using ONLY the Boeing 737 planes.

As you may have heard in the news, there’s been a lot of problems with the aircraft in regards to its computer problems.

Southwest’s success depends on either Boeing fixing this issue or switching to a new airliner altogether.

Switching airplanes would hit them with a hard number in capital expenditures. Given that the majority of their airplanes are owned and only a few are leased.

**Burning Through Cash**

Additionally, Southwest is burning through $30 million in cash per day. According to their CEO, they may have to drastically restructure if they’re not in a better position by September 30.

In my eyes, this may involve its 737 planes I mentioned earlier.

**Oil Prices**

As we saw earlier this month, WTI hit a phenomenon and went negative for the first time in history. Lower oil prices due to a supply shock is good for the airline industry as approximately 40% of their operating expenses come from oil prices.

Unfortunately all that means nothing when states are locked down and travel restrictions are imposed.

**Conclusion**

While Southwest looks better on paper than any of the other airlines, we don’t know whether or not now is the right time to invest. Could the stock go down another 5 points? 10 points? It’s very possible. Or maybe we’ve seen a bottom for airlines. Who knows.

What we do know is that Southwest is cheaper now than before and perhaps worth picking up some shares for the long term (2-3 years).",$LUV in the Time of Corona

investing," \#WellsFargo #GoldmanSachs #stockmarket #takeovers #investing

So, what about the market rumors of yesterday that Goldman Sachs is going to buy out Wells Fargo or another bank?  On the rumor both stocks were up nicely yesterday.  In fact, financials and banking stocks were market leaders across the board yesterday, and they were arguably the leaders in the somewhat dramatic reversal off the market lows that occurred yesterday.  But, what about the rumor?  Is it time to buy either GS or WFC now?  That is the question.

Despite pronouncements and pontifications yesterday that such a buyout is not in the cards and is not even being considered, I would suggest that there are good reasons why such a takeover could occur. 

Perhaps the main reason is that corporate CEO’s, particularly corporate CEO’s in the investment banking industry, the industry to which GS belongs, are at their essence merciless and opportunistic at their very essence.  It is their nature.  That is how they got to where they are today.  They are meat eaters.  Simple as that.  Have you ever heard the term meat eaters?  Something to google in your spare time perhaps.

They’re basically sharks is what I am trying to say.  They wouldn’t have gotten where they are if they were plankton.  Sharks eat other fish.  Corporate CEO’s eat other corporations.  And, by the way, sharks don’t send notice to the fish they are about to eat, that “hey, watchout, here I come to eat you.”  No, they will sneak up quietly and eat the smaller fish before it even knows it is at risk.

My point is that any denials of such a takeover are completely meaningless.  Irrelevant to the analysis as to whether to buy WFC.  I would be very surprised if the corporate chieftans at WFC are not nervous today as they imagine their careers being completely demolished which is what occurs in such takeovers unless things can be negotiated favorably to all parties.

So, I’ll be eagerly watching all the financials and particularly these two for any clues today.  Although I haven’t checked stock quotes in the pre-market my guess is that a quasi-floor in WFC will now begin to take shape unless COVID news once again becomes absolutely horrific, which of course is impossible to predict.

Back to the takeover/merger considerations.  WFC has been a major disappointment to shareholders recently.  Prior to its nice rally yesterday, the stock was trading at yearly lows.  It has been a disappoint for a while now, with bad news coming out periodically almost on cue.  First, a few years back there was the credit card scandal that caused quite a ripple in investor’s perception of WFC.  Recently, there has really been no good news really and the focus has been primarily on reducing costs through continued investments in technology.  And, now with COVID there is obviously concern about loan losses, the need to take additional loan-loss reserves, as well as some concern over whether the dividend may be cut.  

On the other hand, WFC has a fantastic banking franchise with tons of branches and just a solid player in the financial industry.  I bank there and I have absolutely no complaints.  It is a stellar company in so many ways.  

And, that is why it is an obvious takeover target.  If there’s anything that corporate takeover history tells us it is that strong, healthy companies that have underperformed for a while when their stocks are really cheap, are ripe for takeover.  Heck, if I were a corporate CEO I’d love to takeover Wells Fargo.  Wouldn’t you?

GS stock has outperformed WFC since the market bottom by a wide margin.  GS is strong financially with about 133 billion in cash per Value Line as of the close of the 4th quarter.  Both of these companies are financial behemoths with huge market caps.  WFC market cap is actually bigger than GS, but not by that much and once again if corporate takeover history teaches us anything, it is that companies with smaller market caps can eat bigger companies under the right circumstances.

What to do.  I’m a WFC investor.  I’m obviously happy.  I’m just going to sit on my shares and hope there is a quasi-floor somewhere where the stock price is now, now that a takeover premium may come to the rescue of this otherwise dismal performer.  And, I’ll continue to collect my dividend which at current prices is in the 6% - 7% range.  

Is it time to buy WFC stock or call options with fresh money?  Who knows?  Everything is risky these days with COVID news lurking everywhere and with investors experiencing PTSD-like symptoms due to COVID – or should we refer to it as COVID-anxiety syndrome.  Heck, let’s call it that.  That has a nice ring to it.  

So, assuming an investor can overcome his or her COVID-anxiety syndrome and wants to make a financial commitment to a trusted name in banking, a stock with solid financials, that pays a good dividend, and that now may develop a quasi-floor due to takeover rumors, heck, why not buy a few WFC shares.  Or, even maybe even take a flyer on some call options.  I haven’t checked the option prices but I would assume that 30 to 90 calls with low deltas, maybe around .20 would be cheap since the stock is trading at yearly lows.

Disclosure:  I am not a financial professional.  I have absolutely no training in finance, investments, or knowing what I am doing.  Moreover, I own WFC shares so have an incentive for them to go up.  

But, if you are an intrepid investor who is not afraid of this market and not afraid of a little risk, you could probably do worse than buying WFC shares.",Wells Fargo buyout imminent? Time to buy WFC?

Learned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.

\- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)

\- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.

\- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.

\- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.

\- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**

\## **My Strategy now that I have income**

\- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)

\- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:

\- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.

\- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I do this ""1 chip"" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries &amp; ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.

&amp;#x200B;

\## **My current market sentiment**

**-** I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am **\`*****BEARISH\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM - that's enormous.**

\-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**

\- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) &amp; Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**

**-** I am \`**bullish**\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.

\- I am \`**bullish\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am **\`bullish\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am ***\`EXTREMELY BEARISH***\*\*\`\*\* on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am \`**BULLISH\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.

investing,"Hello, I have a question/theory about the stocks and TVIX.

So let's say I have 1million dollar for example  

And I'd like to invest on beaten down stocks like Cruise,Airline,Casino,Energy and etc.

Let's say I put half of my money investing into those stocks. ($500,000)

Now, I'm really worried about this volatile stock market and think it's going to go down after I bought those stocks and would like to put other half ($500,000) on TVIX.

The reason why I'm doing that is because if the market goes down, TVIX will go up and my stocks will go down but depending on stocks TVIX could gain more than I lost on my stocks(Cruise,Airline,Casino,Energy and etc).  
Because if those stocks go down more, at least my TVIX will go up, so I will not lose as much as investing all(1million) into the stocks and also gives me a chance to use the gains on TVIX to buy more on those stocks that are in lower price.

If market goes up, then my stocks will go up but my TVIX will go down obviously .

The reason why I'm writing this is to ask you guys if this is going to work?

What do you think about this theory? I'm really new into the stock market but have been studying the market for a long time. Just wanna know if my theory might work or not.

investing,"In the midst of this virus-induced panic, I have been looking for defensive plays that provide a good valuation with some growth prospects. I like what I see in MDLZ for the most part. Brand recognition is huge in the snacking industry, and I think with names like Oreo and Ritz, the company will be able to hold its own this competitive space. Additionally, I like the fact that the company does business internationally and isn't too dependent on one country or region for its success. With that being said, I have a few concerns about MDLZ. For one, I think the debt load, although certainly manageable, will weigh down on the company's financial flexibility, as current annual FCF only covers about a quarter of long-term debt. Also, revenues have been stagnant while cost-cutting has driven bottom line growth. Although I have mentioned that I believe in the strong brands that MDLZ has to offer, Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) underwent massive write downs in some of its stronger brands. Is it short-sighted to assume that MDLZ won't have a similar decline in brand value?

Personally, I think that in spite of the concerns, MDLZ is well-positioned to take advantage of consumer stockpiling due to COVID. At the very least, this intermediate-term catalyst serves as a good enough reason for me to buy at a price below $45 (roughly 16-17 next year's earnings). I'd love to hear others' opinions about my analysis of the pros and cons and would appreciate any additional insight that people can bring into this discussion, particularly pertaining to MDLZ in the long term.

Nearly 40% of lower-income Americans lost work as the coronavirus pandemic began its assault on the U.S. economy, according to the Federal Reserve.

investing,"So my question is built on the premise that most people have a low income job. Basically, they won't be able to buy a house if they saved up so they take a loan from the bank and spend the next 30+ years paying that off. Pretty basic right?

So add on top of that the car payments, costs that come with the house, college for the kids, vacations etc.etc.etc. Bottomline: You spend your whole life paying the bank its money back + interest instead of approaching life differently.

So here is my perspective:

Instead of buying a house you rent for x amount of years ( I know, people don't like the thought of that but bear with me ). In the meantime you $ cost average in equities and put in a couple of hundred of $ each month into the stockmarket.
If you have a wive you can double that. 

For example: You put in $800 each month ( together ). You save up $9200 per year. Add on top of that the profits that come with your holdings. Let's say a 10% return each year ( which is a realistic number considering the last decade of bull run, if you had invested in some blue chips you would be up WAY more than that. I will go with 10% just for the sake of this example ). After 10-11 years you will be looking at about $180.000. This may not sound much to some of you guys but 180k for a low income family is huge. They can decide to OUTRIGHT BUY A HOUSE with 0 debt at all if the city doesn't have expensive homes. With this simple strategy you just saved up 30+ years of your life being aslave to the banks.

Now, obviously my strategy is based on consistent returns. In the real world things go differently and you may not get 10%. Then again I chose $800 to start off with, but if you doubled that you would get a ton more money as well.

 It's all about the principle. IMO I would take the risk of not getting steady returns ANY DAY over becoming a slave to the bank. Besides, what's the worst thing that could happen? You are still renting right? Your family is safe and you have 0 debt. You lose nothing by going this route instead of the mortgage route. In contrast if you have a mortgage of 30+ years and you lose your job for a year ( which is realistic ) you are still stuck in that never ending cycle of paying back debt + interest and you might never finish it. With this strategy you put yourself into a position to buy freedom.

investing,"Sometimes I want to place several low limit buy orders, expecting that only some of them will be executed.

Additional deposits could be required if this order and orders you previously entered are executed"".

Logically, I would hope that it would just not execute the limit buy orders if I don't have sufficient funds to make the purchase. Is that actually what happens?

investing,"My question is about leveraged ETFs and beta slippage. This is usually explained by saying something like the following: Suppose I have a 2x leveraged derivative Y of an equity X. Suppose X experiences day changes of +10% and -10%, for a total of -1%. Then Y experiences +20% and -20%, for a total of -4%. The loss of Y over the two days is worse than would be expected with 2x leverage. Thus, they say, ""beta slippage"". 

The above assumes a definition of leveraged derivative which to me doesn't make sense. The definition implicit in the above explanation is ""after each day, if X has changed by x%, then Y has changed by 2x%"". This seems wrong to me, in light of what I claim is a much more natural way of targeting the leveraged security.

# The more obvious definition

The thing which should be 2x leveraged shouldnt be the day % change, but its logarithm. For instance, if X increases by x% in a time period, Y should increase by amount y% such that 2log(1+x) = log(1+y). For instance, a 10% increase in X should correspond to a 21% increase in Y, and a 10% decrease in X should correspond to a 19% decrease in Y. Then the total change in Y in the above example is the correct -1.99% you would get corresponding to a -1% change.

I claim this definition is more natural. Why? Well, for one it completely avoids beta slippage as defined in the first paragraph, and percent changes close to zero are very closely doubled, as would be expected. The definition is what you get if you target 2x leverage in % change, not over each day, but over very small intervals (in the limit as those intervals go to zero). Finally, it admits a simple description of the price of Y in terms of the price of X: Y is proportional to X^2. In general an alpha-leveraged derivative should have price proportional to X^alpha.

I therefore have some questions

1. Are leveraged etfs in the wild actually modelled according to the first definition of leverage? that is, they target 2x% change over each day period? If so, why that and not the more natural target of doubling changes over small time periods?
2. Are there leveraged etfs which define the leverage as I proposed above (thus avoiding beta slippage as discussed at the start)?
3. For leveraged securities of either kind, does slippage occur for other reasons? For instance, I would expect some price decay in leveraged securities, but not for the reasons in the first paragraph, but rather for paying margin interest or option premiums or whatever else is used to achieve the leverage.

Thank you for any insight.",Are the usual explanations of beta slippage for leveraged etfs correct?

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Fed ""unlimited QE"" also included buying CDOs in the form of MBS products, allowing companies to switch them out for safer treasury bonds
2. Knowing Wall Street and knowing that they don't have a moral compass as much as we (the average retail investor) would hope they do, they probably sold off a lot of their risk in junk bonds to the Fed
3. If consumers default on private company owned mortgages, it affects the market as a whole in a dominos effect, but what happens when they default on mortgages that are now part of the Fed owned CDOs? Will it affect the market as much? I don't see it happening.

&gt; In nearly three years at the helm of Uber Technologies Inc., Dara Khosrowshahi has focused mostly on cutting costs. Now he’s seeking a return to what defined his career before Uber: buying things.
&gt; 
&gt; Uber is negotiating a potential acquisition of Grubhub Inc. as the coronavirus pandemic drives a surge in demand for food delivery, people familiar with the negotiations said. If a deal is reached, Grubhub, with a market value of $5.3 billion, would be the biggest Khosrowshahi has ever done.
&gt; 
&gt; Khosrowshahi, 50, cultivated a reputation as an effective dealmaker when he ran Expedia Group Inc. for more than a decade. He completed 41 transactions there with a total value of $12.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. His tenure at the online travel giant was defined by a strategy he picked up as a top lieutenant to IAC/InterActiveCorp’s billionaire chairman, Barry Diller: roll up competitors, integrate them and reap the rewards of scale.
&gt; 
&gt; The plan for Grubhub follows the same playbook. The companies anticipate there would be major cost savings by eliminating jobs seen as duplicative, a person familiar with the negotiations said. This form of corporate efficiency—embraced by investors based on the market’s reaction to the news this week—sparked a swift rebuke from some officials in the U.S., one of whom described the proposed merger as “pandemic profiteering.” Through a spokesman, Khosrowshahi declined to be interviewed.
&gt; 
&gt; In the negotiations, Grubhub had been seeking a ratio of 2.15 Uber shares for each one of Grubhub’s, a person familiar with the talks said. The companies are now discussing a deal valuing Grubhub stock at 1.9 Uber shares, the Wall Street Journal reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Khosrowshahi first developed an admiration for Diller in the 1990s while working as an analyst at the investment bank Allen &amp; Co. Diller, a client of the firm, had made a hostile bid for Paramount Pictures. “I thought to myself, ‘That’s the guy I want to work for,’” Khosrowshahi told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2017. He joined in the dot-com boom and worked his way up through Diller’s portfolio of companies, becoming chief executive officer of Expedia in 2005.
&gt; 
&gt; Expedia had already purchased Hotwire and Hotels.com before Khosrowshahi took over, and he accelerated the strategy. “Them rolling up a category is not exactly new,” said Stuart MacDonald, who was Expedia’s chief marketing officer at the time and is now a travel industry consultant. “Dara turbocharged it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Khosrowshahi tried to balance his acquisitiveness with a thriftiness around the office. His desk at Expedia sat in an open-plan office on the 18th floor of a skyscraper in Bellevue, Washinton, overlooking Seattle. He chose not to rent the top floor because he thought it was too expensive, said Mark Okerstrom, who sat beside Khosrowshahi for seven years and worked with him on a series of high-profile deals. “He’s not one of those leaders that presides from an ivory tower,” Okerstrom said.
&gt; 
&gt; Khosrowshahi’s 12-year tenure at Expedia was defined by an escalating battle with Booking Holdings Inc. Each tried to outflank the other by buying upstart brands, splicing them into their tech ecosystems and squeezing out incremental profits. Revenue at Expedia grew to $10.1 billion, from $2.1 billion, and the company’s share price rose nearly sevenfold while Khosrowshahi was in charge.
&gt; 
&gt; His time there culminated with two big deals, one after the other. In 2015, Expedia paid $1.6 billion for Orbitz, swallowing the only serious rival besides Booking to secure a hold of the U.S. market. The Justice Department investigated the antitrust implications for six months and approved the deal. Then, months later, Expedia bought HomeAway for $3.9 billion, helping mount a defense against the latest upstart roiling the industry, Airbnb Inc.
&gt; 
&gt; Neither acquisition went smoothly at first. Revenue took a hit in 2016, due partly to network outages from attempts at merging Orbitz’s systems with Expedia’s and to HomeAway’s runaway spending. “There were a lot of questions at first,” said Okerstrom, who took over as Expedia CEO in 2017 before he was ousted last December after clashing with the board over growth prospects. In hindsight, both deals are seen as largely successful for helping Expedia keep the voracious growth of Booking in check. Despite HomeAway’s costs, it became a core source of growth for the company.
&gt; 
&gt; When Khosrowshahi wants to get serious at the negotiating table, he has a tell. His hand goes behind his neck, his elbow slides across the desk, and he hones in on the subject with a calming timbre. “He leans into the numbers, he leans into the issues, and he leans into you,” said Rob Greyber, who worked with Khosrowshahi at Expedia for about seven years managing the company’s often-fraught relationship with airlines. “In a deal, when there can be a lot of emotion going on, he can snap out of all that, which is a great asset.”
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2017, Khosrowshahi was selected as the unlikely candidate to replace Uber’s co-founder, Travis Kalanick, as CEO. Uber, just eight years old at the time, was already a global behemoth with a valuation far exceeding that of Expedia. Khosrowshahi’s main tasks were to heal a corporate culture that many employees had described as toxic and bring operational discipline. For the latter, he got to work selling assets and cutting costs.
&gt; 
&gt; Uber sold operations in Russia and Southeast Asia for stakes in local ride-hailing companies in 2018. He used the same technique last year to offload Uber’s food business in India to Zomato, eliminating the most costly delivery market for the company. The cuts continued last week with the closure of food delivery in seven countries and the dismissal of 3,700 employees worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; Khosrowshahi has made purchases at Uber, too. In 2018, he acquired Jump, then a tiny startup renting electric bicycles. “Negotiations were directly with him,” said Vivek Ladsariya, a general partner at SineWave Ventures, an investor in Jump. Khosrowshahi sold the Jump business last week to Lime as part of an investment in the scooter-rental startup. In the Middle East, Uber bought ride-hailing company Careem for $3.1 billion, a deal that closed this year. Then Uber said last week it was cutting 31% of Careem’s staff.
&gt; 
&gt; Profit margins are slim in food delivery. Consolidation could help Uber reduce costs and turn a profit. But buying a company the size of Grubhub is a new kind of challenge for Khosrowshahi. “He’s not going to rush into anything,” said Woody Marshall, a venture capitalist who has known Khosrowshahi since they were teenagers.","[Bloomberg] Dara Khosrowshahi, who completed 41 transactions with a total value of $12.7B as Expedia's CEO, is following the same playbook at Uber of buying competitors. The plan for Grubhub follows the same playbook."

TL;DR -

**The bottom line: Patience is the name of the game**

Iben (Dave Iben, chief investment officer and lead portfolio manager at Kopernik Global Investors) believes that investors are well positioned if they exercise patience and wait on non-U.S. companies to take off. He notes that the collection of non-U.S. companies with strong upside potential is the highest he’s seen in his nearly four decades in the industry.

Make no mistake, Iben added, investing outside the U.S. today means being a contrarian, and being willing to be unpopular for a short period of time. But, he remarked, this is the very reason such opportunities exist.

“If investing outside the U.S. were that easy, everyone would do it. It’s never easy to stick your neck out from the crowd, especially in today’s times. However, I believe both history and logic suggest that doing so is worth the short-term pain, because the long-term gains can be pretty significant,” Iben concluded.",The case for international diversification (2020)

I recently started working at a multi-asset class family office shop that manages HNW $$. I come from a deep fundamental value investing background (read: model building) so have little experience with market components besides a high level understanding. My managers are extremely well versed in understanding the components that make up markets and the managers we use for each component. They go deep on analysis regarding the books of our managers - things like the relationship between preferred shares and credit markets at different points in time in the economic cycle or how $$ should be allocated between commercial mortgages and other types of private debt or credit. They seem to know all of this stuff off the top of their heads and understand the dynamics between all of these components to a degree I never even considered. To this end - I could spend a few years learning it from the little tidbits they give me at a time (in their notes, in client meetings, etc) or, preferably, I could learn this stuff on my own. Would anyone have any resources? I wouldn't even mind high level stuff so I could dig deeper as I develop more of an understanding. I am even happy with resources that are within asset classes - for example the relationships between the economic cycle or interest rates and value vs growth, market cap dynamics, etc.

investing,"Hi folks. I wasn’t planning to post this, but I put together some quotes, links, and questions about NKLA to help me decide if I think it’s worth buying. The TLDR is that I don’t want stock at this price, but might buy warrants if the price falls sufficiently. Nel hydrogen (NLLSF) stands to benefit if it works out, so I’m putting some money in that.

Full disclosure, I’m poor, I’m new to investing, and I own TSLA stock. NKLA would seem to be right up my alley, but also a potential competitor to Tesla. Overall I just don’t have confidence in the feasibility of their plans.

Battery claims..

“Nikola’s battery cell has double the energy density, only 40% of the weight and half the cost of 2170 lithium-ion cells used in Teslas and other consumer-market electric vehicles.”

“Nikola Corporation is excited to announce details of its new battery that has a record energy density of 1,100 watt-hours per kg on the material level and 500 watt-hours per kg on the production cell level. The Nikola prototype cell is the first battery that removes binder material and current collectors, enabling more energy storage within the cell.”

“Cycled over 2,000 times with acceptable end-of-life performance”

(Tesla has aimed for good performance at 1,500 cycles and has been exceeding expectations)

“This month, Nikola entered into a letter of intent to acquire a world-class battery engineering team to help bring the new battery to pre-production. Through this acquisition, Nikola will add 15 PhDs and five master’s degree team members. Due to confidentiality and security reasons, additional details of the acquisition will not be disclosed until Nikola World 2020.”

For reference, Tesla’s Model 3 has a functional capacity of around 250 wh/kg. Many people are expecting announcements of substantial improvements at Tesla’s battery day. But regardless, NKLA is claiming twice the capacity of the current leader in energy density.

Not everyone is convinced:

Hydrogen costs..

From https://cafcp.org/content/cost-refill

“Hydrogen fuel prices range from $12.85 to more than $16 per kilogram (kg), but the most common price is $13.99 per kg (equivalent on a price per energy basis to $5.60 per gallon of gasoline), which translates to an operating cost of $0.21 per mile. [presumably passenger cars]

While future price is uncertain, NREL estimates that hydrogen fuel prices may fall to the $10 to $8 per kg range in the 2020 to 2025 period. A kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline. FCEVs are about twice as efficient as gasoline-powered vehicles: an FCEV travels about twice as far as a conventional vehicle given the same amount of fuel energy. At $3.50 per gallon gasoline, a conventional vehicle costs about $0.13 per mile to operate, while an FCEV using $8 per kg hydrogen fuel would cost about $0.12 per mile.”

This is from a pro-hydrogen group, which may be overly optimistic and anticipate a ‘hydrogen economy’.

Electric “fuel” costs $.04/mile for the Tesla Model S

“With 100 miles using 34kWh (about 100 MPG) and electricity costing an average of $0.12/kWh, the yearly cost to drive a Tesla Model S 85D 15,000 miles is $612.”

Funding..

A lot of their investments are in the form of goods and services. https://www.trucks.com/2019/09/23/funding-hydrogen-truck-builder-nikola-motor/

These investments may be contingent on certain thresholds or contracts for services. Milton makes it sound like huge players are making big commitments, but it may mean “if you pull this off we’ll give you a discount on your first $100m in services you pay us for”.

For example: Nel hydrogen (NLLSF) invested $5m, and will provide hydrogen production, storage, and fueling equipment to what looks like hundreds of planned stations. They have a $1b market cap, so gambling $5m on perhaps the largest hydrogen contract ever is a no brainer.

Other challenges:

Air filtering may struggle/clog in real world situations

Hydrogen infrastructure

Service infrastructure

Compressed flammable gas could cause PR issues, unknown crash safety

Comparing to Tesla..

Unknown but boring and eloquent CEO vs eccentric CEO with engineering knowledge and other successful projects

Expensive energy source which requires transport or complex production equipment vs dirt cheap energy from grid

Improved driver experience (more room, digital mirrors, quiet) vs autopilot or FSD and advanced safety features (detecting hazards).

Top down/design heavy approach vs first principles/testing heavy approach

Narrow focus on product lines vs diverse revenue streams: home and grid-scale energy production and storage, electric vehicles (including subscription services), rumors of HVAC and other products in the works

fast fueling vs slow fueling

Comparable range to diesel vs reduced range

Advantages:

Range

Reasonable fuel fill time

Perceived as environmentally friendly (depends on execution)

Big financial backers

Preorders

Disadvantages:

Hydrogen fuel cell technology is sort of dumb from an energy use and efficiency standpoint
(https://youtu.be/xU-LDZ0HTGc)

Requires substantial fueling infrastructure investment

Fuel will be expensive unless sold at a loss or subsidized

Products and designs are unproven, and may be difficult to produce profitably at scale

Questions:

If they have a battery with twice the Tesla capacity, why not focus on battery only versions with twice the range of the Tesla semi? There’s no need for rapid fueling if it  can do 1,000 miles loaded.. it could just charge up at the destination. And drivers have to sleep anyway. Electric infrastructure is so much simpler.

Why now? Wouldn’t doing an IPO in better economic conditions yield better results? Perhaps they are struggling to stay afloat because most investors are providing goods and services.

Is the battery just theoretical/lab experiments? If they are bringing on PhDs to bring it to pre-production.. that doesn’t sound like proven technology.

If the battery is a fantasy, the range may also be exaggerated. They plan to have a pickup truck model called Badger:

“Milton is promising some eye-popping specs for the Badger, including up to 600 miles of range with a full tank of hydrogen and up to 300 miles of range on battery power alone. The Badger is supposed to be able to generate over 900 horsepower and go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.9 seconds.”

So the battery is intended to contribute about half the range. Again, why not design all these vehicles to be fully electric?

Tesla Model S has a range of 373 miles (maybe 400), and can recharge 136 miles of capacity in 15 minutes. Surely replacing the hydrogen hardware with additional battery capacity could hit 500+ miles.

On the other hand, if they are exaggerating the battery capacity by 33%, the total range might be more like 500/200. In which case the range isn’t much better, and the extra cost is just for fast refueling time.

I’m trying to keep an open mind. But these seem like vehicles that will cost more to operate than diesel, with no established infrastructure to fuel or service them.

The CEO is a smooth talker, and doesn’t commit SEC violations on Twitter. I think he’s convinced backers and investors that he can deliver, even if it’s not a great business model. They are intrenched in a patent dispute which seems to be stalling Tesla’s progress on the semi. The only way I see this working is with massive subsidies and credits from governments, which is definitely possible.

Conclusion: I’m not touching this unless it drops substantially. If the price gets back down near $10 I’ll buy some warrants, which are basically $11.50 call options executable in 1-5 years (details below). I am however, accumulating some shares of Nel (NLLSF). I can’t find financial info on them, but they are an established company that has products to sell. If NKLA pulls off this stunt, Nel will benefit greatly. If NKLA goes bankrupt, Nel should be fine. Currently trading at $1.25, with almost a billion shares in circulation.

Warrants: (VTIQW) In case anyone is looking for the specifics.. Looks like they become exercisable in 12 months, and NKLA can give notice to exercise if they are above $18 for 20 out of 30 days after that. Otherwise they are good for 5 years.

From: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746918003835/a2235755z424b4.htm#dc10001_description_of_securities

The warrants will become exercisable, subject to the above limitations, on the later of:

§ 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; and

§ 12 months from the closing of this offering.

The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation; provided, however, that the private warrants issued to Cowen Investments will not be exercisable more than five years after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(G)(i).

Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (excluding the private warrants as described below):

§ in whole and not in part;

§ at a price of $0.01 per warrant;

§ upon a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of redemption, which we refer to as the 30-day redemption period; and

§ if, and only if, the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.

We will not redeem the warrants unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the warrant shares underlying the warrants to be so redeemed is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those warrant shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.

If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption, each warrant holder may exercise his, her or its warrants prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the shares of common stock may fall below the $18.00 trigger price (as adjusted) as well as the $11.50 exercise price (as adjusted) after the redemption notice is issued.

The redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.

If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a ""cashless basis."" In making such determination, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. In such event, the holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of warrant shares underlying the warrants to be so exercised, and the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value by (y) the fair market value.",Some thought on NKLA/VTIQ

NetApp just hired on a 27 yr Microsoft exec as their President. The previous CEO retired due to a personal goal to retire by 60.

investing,"The recent surge in popularity of Wallstreetbets sub has brought an influx of people to r/investing peddling harmful information for new investors, and it pains me to see a sub that was such a great resource for me when I started out investing become infested with losing strategies. Study after study shows that 90% of options traders lose money, that the vast majority of people who try to time the market lose out in the long run, and that almost 92% of actively managed large cap funds lost to the S&amp;P 500 over the last 15 year period. Despite these facts, these losing strategies have been all I have been seeing on this sub over the last few months.

If the data isn't convincing for you, I've got a story for you about the smartest man I know. Only person I know who got a perfect score on the SATs. Undergraduate and graduate degree in economics and finance from an Ivy League school, after which he became a CFA. Earned multi, multi, millions as a portfolio manager, before retiring young in his late 30's or early 40's. You want to know how he invests now that he is retired? Passive index funds. Do you want to know where he told me most of his hedge fund and mutual fund manager friends invest their own money? Passive Index funds. 

Honestly, over the past few months, wallstreetbets has been a considerably less harmful sub for new investors than here. There seems to be an overarching theme over there that they know they are gamblers and dumbasses, where the options traders here seem to think they are the smartest guys in the room. At least they have funny memes over there to help ease the pain when they inevitably lose their money.

I don't know what the solution to this is, I'm not sure if banning advice that has been statistically proven to lose money for most investors is a good idea. All I know is that this sub has become a place that is peddling advice that will lose new investors money, and I think it's atrocious. End rant.

investing,"A recap of the negative prices seen in the May WTI oil futures: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1lhy2h328jhpt/Inside-the-Biggest-Oil-Meltdown-in-History

Here's my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong):

- On April 20, oil futures went negative. At one point, it was -$40.32 a barrel with a minimum contract of 1000 barrels. This means that someone holding this contract would PAY the buyer $40,320 to accept the 1000 barrels.
- The contracts have a stipulation that it must be delivered in Cushing, OK. Cushing, OK was very close to or was at storage capacity.

**My question here is why wouldn't the holder of the contract just refuse delivery instead of paying someone to accept the oil?** My understanding is that since a contract is a legal requirement, the holder of the contract would face severe legal action if they refused delivery, and thus, paying someone to take the oil off their hands is better than the alternative of legal action.

This leads to my next question: **What happens to those who purchased the contracts at -$40?** They couldn't possibly accept deliveries since Cushing, OK was at capacity. Will they face severe legal action?  

I'm likely missing something here, since the article goes on to say:

&gt;Of course, Trump was conflating his markets. The negative prices primarily stalked the May crude oil futures contract, not the markets for physical barrels. If the president was waiting for people to line up to help him fill the SPR with millions of barrels of free oil, says one trader who oversees physical oil trades in both the U.S. and Canadian markets, he’d still be waiting.

&gt;“I think the consensus among physical traders when we see crude futures get that chaotic and wonky is not to trade them. Sometimes it’s just better to sit things out.”

&gt; The futures market demonstrated no convergence with the physical market that day.

**How could it be that the futures market does not translate to the physical market since a future is just an agreement for delivery at a later date?** Shouldn't someone be facing severe legal action here?",What happened to oil deliveries from the May Futures?

But when liquidity is not tight like right now, I don’t see how QE is helpful. So when the banks sell their treasuries to the Fed, they get reserves for it. But if these banks were selling these bonds on the open market they would have got money for it too. The same thing is happening now. If these banks wanted to increase their reserves they just sell their treasuries. So what difference does it make if the Fed is buying these bonds or if some pension fund is buying them. The result is the same. Like I said earlier, I understand there is a difference when markets are tight and the Fed is the only buyer. But when the market is functioning fine, I don’t see what difference QE made. The banks will create reserves wether it came from me or you buying these bonds to the Fed.

Hey all, here's my Tesla (TSLA) Valuation Model, up until 2030:

# [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFNyL5k2vEELjfMOGEsF0Rdj8C1taHdOzukfuA8oY9c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFNyL5k2vEELjfMOGEsF0Rdj8C1taHdOzukfuA8oY9c/edit?usp=sharing)

This model provides data including and excluding Autonomous MaaS (AMaaS) revenue, allowing for comparison of potential outcomes dependant on whether full Autonomy is achieved and marketable as a robotaxi program in the next decade.

I believe that this model is relatively conservative in both financial calculations and production growth predictions. This is in comparison to both statements by the companies and to predictions from many buy-side analysts, namely ARK Invest and Baron Funds.

\-----------------------------

# tl;dr:

2030 predictions excluding AMaas: &gt;!$5235 share price from $591B revenue, $158B profit, $1.6T market cap!&lt;

2030 predictions including AMaas: &gt;!$24844 share price from $1.28T revenue, $365B profit, $5.8T market cap!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**major notes:**

predicted 1.2m vehicle sales 2024 is 40% of Musk's stated expectation of 3m

AMaaS release 5yrs behind Musk's original timeline

predicted auto production growth is 35-40% yoy, Musk has stated that he expects 50% yoy

% AMaaS vehicles on network and hrs/week could be 2-3x realistically once safety and owner profitability has been proven

comparing EV/EBIT and P/S ratios to similar growth companies and the total market in general (as of Feb20) portrays the predicted 2030 valuations as extremely conservative and could realistically be 1.5-3x

vehicle and energy production costs (and thus gross margins) have been modelled in line with Wright's Law; prices have been modelled to steadily decline with costs - alternatively, Tesla could maintain prices and allow their margins to increase much faster

^(\^these points and many others are further explained within the Notes section of the spreadsheet)

&amp;#x200B;

Despite my longer term (4-10 years) expectations remaining unchanged, here are my model updates for 2020 estimates specifically regarding potential CoViD impact:

&gt;**2020 estimates pre-CoViD:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Auto Total #: 520000  
&gt;  
&gt;Auto ASP: $55000  
&gt;  
&gt;Auto Gross Margin: 21%  
&gt;  
&gt;Energy MWh deployed: 2700  
&gt;  
&gt;Energy $/MWh: $735  
&gt;  
&gt;Energy Gross Margin: 15%  
&gt;  
&gt;EOY Share Price: $1088  
&gt;  
&gt;**2020 estimates post-CoViD:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Auto Total #: 419000 (-20%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Auto ASP: $49000 (-11%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Auto Gross Margin: 20% (-5%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Energy MWh deployed: 2160 (-20%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Energy $/MWh: $698 (-5%)  
&gt;  
&gt;Energy Gross Margin: 15% (no change)  
&gt;  
&gt;EOY Share Price: $806 (-26%)

&amp;#x200B;

Expect another update in the next couple of weeks following Battery Investor Day. The date for this event is yet to be confirmed, however it has long been expected April or May. It may not occur until early-June, however Musk maintains that they will be revealing some of the most important battery-related plans and information of Tesla's history. I am expecting long-term plans to be revealed for multi-TWh battery production in the next decade, allowing for something ridiculous like 20M vehicles *annually.* If they reveal anything crazy like this I'll definitely be updating the model with that kind of growth.

investing,"TLDR: Divest from the devil you crazy, lovely humans.

Even if you’re winning, you are winning yourself and your children out of a future. You’ve decided it’s best to delude yourself into thinking you can out swim the sharks when in reality they just haven’t come for you yet. You were given this notion at birth when your parents and the culture around you threw you into the ocean and forgot to tell you there’s land should you choose to get out. 

You participate in a system that thinks making bigger and better boats with bigger and better sails will fix the hole in the bottom and save you from the metaphorical sharks, and you’ve forgotten that all you are really doing is not sinking. But we’ve largely forgotten about the hole in the bottom. Even today, we read the news headlines from the captain saying, “That’s not a hole”. And we believe it even as we stare at the hole. We used to know what holes were. 

We occasionally dream of land, but can’t seem to understand how you would sail the boat on land. What a silly notion, land. How would I function on stable ground?

We have become perpetually okay with sea sickness and have found that staring at a stabilized myriad of screens for hours on end will help us forget about the uneasiness in the pits of our stomachs telling us, “listen to me! I am not okay”!

Even the most enlightened seafarers have come to realize that, if we look far enough into the future, nothing truly matters so why not make the best boat possible? They too have forgotten about the shore. Are they merely reaching for any rational to continue doing the only thing they know how to do — afraid of the change?

The most ignorant make their living actively forgetting the hole while doing nothing else. They serve a purpose, however, because if anyone were to genuinely look at the hole for even a second outside of their at-birth conditioning, they might be able to spread the word to others. We must...forget...the hole.

Some of the radically minded groups on the ship also make a living at the holes expense. They point directly at the hole and shout, “this hole will eventually kill us all”. But they may be the worst of the lot. Suffering from some sort of chronic Stockholm syndrome, they would be completely lost, we’re it not for the hole to rebel against. They too need the boat, however they’ve given up caring whether or not it has functioning sails.

A growing number of people in recent times, have either jumped off the ship or been forced off. Most of them swim alongside the boat, cold, wet and eating food scraps thrown overboard by the boat-dwellers that look on in pity and disgust. They are confused by those that swim away, and long for the days when they too had unstable ground beneath their legs

A brave few make the jump intentionally and swim for the horizon. They have stopped ignoring the hole, and they have stopped trying to get others to see the hole. These are fruitless pursuits. They have learned that the boat made all of its most important discoveries long ago, and has spent countless years since in a state of dogmatic vigilance. They have realized there is a purpose, and they can make it. As they took their leap they smiled at the thought that they have quite possibly made their first real choice in their entire live. They immediately began to miss those they left on the boat, unable to help.

Every day I get closer to the edge and imagine myself taking the plunge. A part of me is frightened of certain death, and another part of me must constantly tell myself that it is a rebirth. The boat is still speaking to me. She is the only siren I have ever known.

I write you this letter now as this is likely one of my last attempts at freeing you from the sea before I make the jump. Please, LOOK AT THE HOLE!!",You’re all losing money

investing,"Uber should generate around $12b in revenue this year. It is fair to say that they will probably burn through at least $10b. Investors have 2 main issues with Uber right now 1. Their ridiculous cash burn. 2. Their end game. 

1. This is short term and shouldn’t be a problem for more than a few years. Before covid Uber was suggesting positive EBITA by years end.

2. So let’s first look at a simple bear case for Uber. Uber is in a hyper competitive market that is really in its infancy. There is no doubt that self driving cars are rapidly approaching and with companies such as Google and Tesla who needs Uber in the long run? Uber’s tech can be easily replaced where as self driving cars cannot.

Ok compelling - why I’m a bull. Uber will be the gig economy. 

Sure, companies such as google and Tesla have technology that Uber cannot match. But here is why that doesn’t matter so much:

- Uber holds tremendous value in terms of data and brand recognition that makes them a prime candidate for a partnership. They’ve already formed a partnership with Toyota for example. A company such as waymo entering this new space would take on a whole lot less risk if they partnered with Uber. 

- In the future a much smaller percentage of Uber’s revenue will come from ride-share. Think about it, Uber is in a great place to make acquisitions. We have seen it this week with talks to buy grubhub. There are plenty of companies out there with synergies to Uber. There are already well over 100 gig economy companies that Uber can take aim at - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gig_economy_companies

In summary I see Uber as the future for all things Gig. You want gig shipping - you go Uber, you want gig work (Fiverr right now) you go Uber, you want your house cleaned you go Uber, you want your dog taken for a fucking walk you go Uber. You want a coshared ride in a Toyota self driving car you go through Uber.

""Federal agents seized a cellphone belonging to a prominent Republican senator on Wednesday night as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into controversial stock trades he made as the novel coronavirus first struck the U.S., a law enforcement official said.

Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, turned over his phone to agents after they served a search warrant on the lawmaker at his residence in the Washington area, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a law enforcement action.

...

To obtain a search warrant, federal agents and prosecutors must persuade a judge they have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed. The law enforcement official said the Justice Department is examining Burr's communications with his broker.

Such a warrant being served on a sitting U.S. senator would require approval from the highest ranks of the Justice Department and is a step that would not be taken lightly. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment.""

investing,"TLRD:US has gone down by 95% or so already, to $0.98 USD. Yet sellers may have made mistakes in valuing this business.
Perhaps due to the some mental shortcuts, like:
Social proof:
They see what the crowd is doing (selling) and they feel comfort in doing the same thing, even if they are wrong.

Scarcity:
People see a recession coming and they want money in their own hands. This drives down the price further.

Authority:
People tell them that brick and mortar stores are going out of business due to internet retailing. Not really applicable in this case, because suits need to be measured.

Reciprocation:
The stock has lost a great deal of money for them, so they want to pay it back by driving the price even lower.

Also, losses are more painful than gains so they probably want to be rid of it just so they don’t see it anymore.

Or other factors such as:

Leverage:
If they are leveraged, they may be forced to sell the stock regardless of their desire to keep it. This doesn’t apply to us!

Also there are psychological motivators such as:
Incentives (extreme fear, wanting to make their money fast - so looking for the hot new opportunity)

Denial (they see what they could have spent the money on otherwise)

Pavlovian association (feeling like they are being punished for holding the stock, association of suits with funeral wear due to constant pandemic coverage and so on)

Stress induced misjudgments (perhaps due to leverage)

Extra vivid evidence (recent bankruptcies of Nordstrom and J Crew).

Analysing the raw numbers shows it is unlikely that TLRD:US will go out of business, as they have had between $11m and $240m of free cash flow annually in the last 5 years. The company is also the largest retailer of formalwear and therefore likely has many economies of scale.

Human misjudgments have therefore likely made this the deal of the year, due to the lollapalooza effect of multiple mental shortcuts and multiple misjudgment factors.

When we purchase, we can probably expect the price to drop further.

My prediction is that once the big dividends kick back in, the reciprocation tendencies to drive down the price further will fade. Once the price stabilises, a new type of social proof can arise and the stress induced misjudgements can decrease. These are causes which would work to show the real value of the business and therefore drive the price up, perhaps significantly. Once the pandemic coverage ceases, positive pavlovian associations can kick in.

At the current time we can get more value than we have paid for. TLRD:US is now selling for less than $50m USD (private market sale price) yet has nearly 1700 stores, 17000 employees, $3.3B in sales and between $11m-$240m in Free Cash Flow annually. That is like buying a grocery store for about one to five years of net profit.

Additionally it is the largest formalwear provider in the USA, with corresponding efficiencies of scale that are unavailable to most competitors.

Also, TLRD:US debt is funded by 4.5% bonds. If inflation rises to its historical average of between 2% and 4%, the debt burden of TLRD:US will be far lighter than it is at present.

A strong inflationary force at this time is the Fed printing trillions of dollars, because it makes each USD purchase less than it did previously. If inflation goes above 4.5%, the $2.2B worth of bonds will actually become assets on the balance sheet of TLRD:US and they will be a corresponding liability for the fixed debt bondholders.",Why TLRD:US market participants have likely misjudged

investing," I have been looking at the history of oil ETFs specifically USO and how their price correlates to the rise/fall of oil prices. The history of USO seems to be that it tanks when oil tanks, trades sideways when oil prices go sideways, and trades sideways when oil prices surge. Just look at the 2008-2015 oil market bull run and the USO stock price during that period. USO traded sideways. And when oil prices tanked last month, USO dropped so hard they had to do a reverse split. With this in mind are OIL ETFs literally designed to lose money over time, at least in the long term? I cannot imagine a single scenario in which oil prices rise/fall and USO increases in stock prices due to this history.

If a company has $10m in earnings (revenue-expenses) per year, and $100 in assets-liabilities=equity, if we assume that nothing really changes would those earnings more or less translate into increases in assets (or decreases in liabilities such as paying down debt)?

Essentially I'm asking if Equity is the Integral of Earnings on average. To reverse that earnings would be the derivative (change) in equity. If this is not the case what might be some situations that would cause it to be different?

Is this the right place to ask this? I'm trying to understand finance from a fundamentals perspective and I want to know how much calculus applied to accounting could be used to evaluate companies.

I'm thinking that the equation that Value = Equity + Earnings\*Coefficient should be a decent way to do it under the assumption that X years of earnings is ""baked"" into the value of the company under the assumption that earnings will translate into equity and I want to know how accurate my intuition is in this situation.",Would Net Earnings generally translate into increases in Net Equity?

investing,"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-13/uber-grubhub-bond-sale

&gt; Uber Technologies Inc. has made an offer to acquire Grubhub Inc., a move that could combine two of the largest food-delivery apps in the U.S. as the novel coronavirus — and the stay-at-home orders meant to limit the virus’ spread — drives a surge in demand, according to people familiar with the matter.
&gt; 
&gt; The companies are in talks about a deal and could reach an agreement as soon as this month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Deliberations are ongoing, and talks could still fall through, the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; Although neither company confirmed the talks, they both said they’re always looking for opportunities to provide value to their businesses.
&gt; 
&gt; On Wednesday, Uber brought a $900-million bond sale. That’s up from a planned $750-million sale, which the company said may be used for acquisitions, among other general corporate purposes. The five-year notes, which can’t be bought back for two years, will yield 7.5%, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction.
&gt; 
&gt; ADVERTISING
&gt; 
&gt; Promote health. Save lives. Serve the vulnerable. Visit who.int
&gt; S&amp;P Global Ratings grades Uber’s new unsecured notes as CCC+, or seven levels below investment grade. Moody’s Investors Service rates them B3, one step higher than S&amp;P.
&gt; 
&gt; Grubhub, founded in 2004, is the oldest of the major food delivery companies in the United States. In recent years, competition from DoorDash Inc. and Uber has squeezed Grubhub’s profit margins. The pandemic is adding more pressure, forcing Grubhub to withdraw its 2020 financial guidance last month. Uber pulled its forecast too, and said a plan to turn a quarterly adjusted profit this year would be delayed until 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of a series of cost-cutting movies, Uber said last week that it is ending its food-delivery operations in seven countries where the service has proved unpopular. Those markets represented 1% of Uber Eats’ gross bookings and 4% of the business’ adjusted loss before interest, taxes and other expenses for the first quarter of 2020, the company said. Uber’s ride-hailing business has been hammered by the global pandemic, but in the U.S. and other developed markets, delivering meals has helped the San Francisco company drive sales as people mostly stay at home.
&gt; 
&gt; Food delivery remains largely unprofitable. That dynamic has led to much speculation about potential consolidation in the industry. DoorDash, which is privately held and backed by SoftBank Group Corp., is the most popular in the U.S., followed by Grubhub and Uber. Any merger between the major apps could draw antitrust scrutiny. Together, Uber and Grubhub could account for 55% of the market, according to Wedbush Securities.
&gt; 
&gt; A deal “would help consolidate the U.S. online food delivery market and reduce cash burn,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior industry analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a note Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, these companies face calls from officials to improve conditions for their gig economy workers. California’s attorney general sued Uber and ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc. last week, alleging they’re in violation of a state law designed to give their workers the benefits due to employees. A loss in that case could set a precedent that increases costs for the companies and raises further questions about their ability to be profitable.
&gt; 
&gt; Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the House antitrust subcommittee, said the proposed deal underscores the urgency for a moratorium on most mergers, an idea supported by other Democrats. “Uber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage. Its attempt to acquire Grubhub — which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees — marks a new low in pandemic profiteering,” Cicilline said in a statement.
&gt; 
&gt; Restaurant advocates also said they were worried about the potential consequences of an Uber-Grubhub combination. “It’s extremely concerning,” said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a group that represents restaurants in New York. Grubhub and its Seamless division already dominate the city, Rigie said, “and they use their leverage and market share at the expense of local restaurants.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bradley Tusk, an early Uber advisor who has since sold his stake in the company, said that if the policies cities are considering take hold long term, “it may be that consolidation is the only way to have a couple of market players that can survive at all.” Otherwise, food delivery could end up looking like the costly ride-hailing rivalry between Uber and Lyft, Tusk said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Uber should have found a way to buy or kill Lyft a lot earlier,” Tusk said. “The unit economics of ride sharing would be a lot easier if they had, and I think they’re trying to learn that lesson now with the acquisition of Grubhub.”","[LATimes] Uber offers to buy Grubhub, plans to sell $900M in bonds"

investing,"Remember when Helios and Matheson stock traded at $5000 just two years ago? Of course you don't it traded only around $30, but if you look at the chart now that $30 shows up as $5000/share. Today it trades at $0.0004. This of course happened becuase when companies start losing money, they must start printing shares to keep the company alive.

&amp;#x200B;

So for those of you investing in companies that are down big time and you think will recover, take a minute to think, will this company start printing shares? One thing to watch out for a **S-3 sec filing** aka a shelf offering / ATM offering it stands for At-The-Market but it equally thought of as a ATM machine for the company to print shares and sell them at-the-market price. Airlines/ Casinos/ rental cars. Don't be suprised when you read about these things in the future, if not already. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing is **convertible notes** \- its a bond, but if the company doesn't pay back the bond then the lender can convert it into shares, which they will dump on the open market. Those shares of course are printed out of thin air. Here's a example of how toxic the term's can get 

&gt; At various times, the Company entered into Convertible Promissory Notes on various terms accredited institutional investors.  The debentures are convertible at the discounts of between fifty percent (50%) and sixty percent (60%) of the market price of the Company’s Common Stock determined based on the lowest trading price in a twenty (20) to twenty-five (25) day period prior to the date of conversion or the average of a three (3) period closing price of the Company’s stock.  

Basically they issue a bond and if the company doesn't pay it back, they issue shares a 50% off the lowest trading price in the past month. So if the stock trades at a dollar, these guys get shares at 50cents. And then the next person to convert a note get's shares at 25cents after the first guy drives the price down when his cheaply printed shares.","You've heard of the money printer, now meet the CommonStock Printer.

investing,"Starting yesterday, airline stocks have been tanking-- especially today-- under the claim via multiple news sites that Boeing's CEO, David Calhoun, said an airline would ""most likely"" go bankrupt in September-- based on an [interview from Tuesday's Today Show](https://www.today.com/video/boeing-ceo-it-could-take-3-to-5-years-for-airline-industry-to-return-from-apocalyptic-state-83326533868?mod=article_inline).

This is totally misinformation, that has been unfortunately spread by NBC.

What actually happened is that interviewer Savannah Guthrie, gave a long supposition, and asked Calhoun to agree with it:

&gt;GUTHRIE: The money that the government used to bailout the airlines runs out in September, so they are going to have to start laying off people. Do you expect that the airlines to be able to survive this?   Do you think there might be a major U.S. carrier that just has to go out of business?  
&gt;  
&gt;CALHOUN: **Well, I don't want to get too predictive on that subject**, but yes, most likely. You know, something will have to happen when September comes around... 

She put words into his mouth, and asked two different questions at the same time-- the first being an obvious yes, the second should have been a ""no."" He may have already been primed to answer, as indicated by his stumbling response, then merely blurted out, ""but yes, most likely."" 

Before the full interview was released, [NBC News PR edited the segment in a post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NBCNewsPR/status/1259970858447253505) -- making Calhoun reply, ""Yes, most, likely"" only to the last part, and leaving out the rest of what he said!  

It's a case of unethical editing -- which was then propagated by other sources.

[*USA Today* picked it up](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/05/11/boeing-ceo-predicts-major-airline-go-out-business-coronavirus-pandemic/3113292001/?mod=article_inline), sourcing the NBC News PR Twitter edited version.

Based on the *USA Today* story, [Marketwatch repeated the claim](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-major-us-airline-most-likely-will-go-bankrupt-boeing-ceo-says-in-interview-2020-05-12)

Reuters, usually a trustworthy source, [further spread the misquote](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-boeing-airlines/boeing-ceo-sees-passenger-levels-under-25-in-september-pain-for-airlines-nbc-interview-idUSKBN22N31M) which ended up getting reprinted in multiple places.

A writer at *Forbes* then amped the claim, saying Calhoun ""[responded quickly and strongly, “Yes, most likely.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willhorton1/2020/05/12/boeing-ceo-expects-airline-bankruptcy--what-did-he-really-mean-about-coronavirus-impacts/#6c79022d344a)

*Barron's* [similarly spread the news](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-calhoun-airlines-bankruptcy-credit-default-swaps-51589294871): ""Boeing Predicts an Airline Bankruptcy.""

Boeing had to put out a statement about Calhoun's quote, via spokesman Gordon Johndroe: “He was speaking to the general uncertainty in the sector, not about any one particular airline.” But it was too late -- the damage was already being done to all the industry components.

What was Calhoun thinking, showing up on the TODAY show for an interview, as a new CEO? There was no benefit to his company. The pulled quote has now cost billions of dollars in lost market cap for all the major airlines, which means they have less financial resources to buy from Boeing.",Boeing CEO did not say an airline would go bankrupt in September.

IMO, Prof. Damodaran is among the most informative and entertaining academics in finance. He's been doing regular updates on region, sector and category performance during this crisis. This is part 8. If you don't feel like nerding out for half an hour, here's the TL;DW: 

1. Commodities have taken a hit, particularly oil (for multiple reasons). Gold has done well, though perhaps not as well as expected. Bitcoin hasn't acted like gold.
2. Developing markets have underperformed developed markets during the crisis. Latin America has been hardest-hit.
3. The crisis has been selective/orderly in its damage dealt across sectors. Healthcare/Technology have fared well while Airlines/Oil/Finance have been hard hit.
4. Growth has outperformed value, continuing a decade-long trend, but in defiance of the overall market outperformance of value.
5. Large-cap has outperformed small-cap during the crisis, continuing a decade of outperformance, but in defiance of the overall trend.
6. Passive has outperformed active during a crisis across most categories, confounding one of the last remaining arguments for active investing.

The last point is the one I found most interesting. Even if you couldn't predict the crisis, you hypothetically could've gotten out before the worst or picked stocks less hit by the crisis. Yet a comparison of passive vs. active managed funds shows passive outperforming active even during a crisis. He expects this performance to accelerate the ongoing stampede of money out of active investing.

""Today's reversal sends a clear message to China that there are consequences for its malign behaviour."" The decision marks a win for China hawks in Washington, who have taken advantage of deteriorating relations with Beijing over the origins of the coronavirus to push measures that are tough on China.  


The Trump administration recently released rules to make it tougher to export certain types of advanced technology to China and is accelerating efforts to remove global industrial supply chains from China.  


President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of failing to alert the world about the severity and scope of the virus, which has killed more than 80,0000 people in the US and originated in the city of Wuhan, China, late last year.  


The FRTIB decided in 2017 to make the investment shift in the second half of 2020 to boost returns, a decision hailed by unions arguing federal workers should have the same rights as other employees to invest in emerging market indexes that include China.

&gt; The New York City Council compared food ordering apps like Grubhub and UberEats to blood-sucking parasites on Wednesday before passing emergency legislation aimed at helping struggling restaurants lower their delivery costs during the coronavirus pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; During the state of emergency caused by the coronavirus, food ordering and delivery apps will not be allowed to charge restaurants more than 15 percent in delivery fees and 5 percent for any other takeout order fees.
&gt; 
&gt; The city council will also ban these apps from charging restaurants for telephone calls that never resulted in a food order — a practice Grubhub came under fire for last year following exclusive reporting by The Post.
&gt; 
&gt; During a hearing that preceded the vote on Wednesday, councilman Francisco Moya, who represents Jackson Heights and Corona, compared Grubhbub to a “leach” that is “sucking the life and blood out of restaurants.”
&gt;

&gt; Food ordering and delivery apps like Grubhub can charge restaurants commissions that can range from 12 to 40 percent of a single order.
&gt; 
&gt; Grubhub, which is reportedly an acquisition target by Uber, has threatened legal action against the city council over the legislation, which it has slammed as an “overstep.”
&gt; 
&gt; City Council Speaker Corey Johnson discounted such threats.
&gt; 
&gt; “We do believe we have the legal authority,” he said. “We’ve spent a lot of time looking at these issues. So I believe we’re on solid legal grounds and I’m not concerned about this challenge.”
&gt; 
&gt; Councilman Justin Brandon said he thinks the new rules will actually help food ordering and delivery apps get more business.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a very, very fair bill. It’s going to help a lot of restaurants, and I think, actually it’s going to create more business for our restaurants and for our delivery workers because the lower fees will actually get more of the restaurants to use these apps.”
&gt; 
&gt; Three other bills were passed that prevent commercial landlords from going after the personal assets of small-business owners affected by COVID-19, and to protect them against harassment. Another bill suspends sidewalk cafe fees.
&gt; 
&gt; As The Post reported Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he supports the legislation and is expected to sign it into law. The new rules will remain in effect for 90 days past the state of emergency lifting.
&gt; 
&gt; “What we’re doing today is helping these small businesses survive this crisis,” said Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who sponsored the bills and has been critical of food delivery company fees in the past.",[NYPost] The New York City Council compared food ordering apps like Grubhub and UberEats to blood-sucking parasites on Wednesday before passing emergency legislation to cap no more than 15% in delivery fees and 5% for any other takeout order fees.

Uber (NYSE:UBER 33.02 1.91%) rattled the food delivery segment when reports emerged on Tuesday that it was exploring a potential buyout of Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB 58.14 -3.73%) – an online food ordering and delivery service that competes with Uber Eats. Although CNBC’s reporting on the matter yesterday appeared to imply that the deal was far from certain, a fresh development today seems to indicate that the negotiations may have graduated to an advanced stage.

Uber has now proposed the offering of senior notes, bearing a principal amount of $750 million and maturing in 2025. According to the company’s press release, the notes will be offered to qualified institutional investors. In a crucial caveat, the press release states:

“Uber intends to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.”

As a refresher, CNBC reported yesterday that Uber and Grubhub have held buyout negotiations recently and that the latest all-stock proposal offered 2.15 shares in Uber for every Grubhub share. However, according to CNBC’s sources, Grubhub has rejected this proposal. Bear in mind that the two companies have held intermittent talks on this matter for about a year now.

With that being said, I have a few questions that I hope people with more experience than I can answer or at least guide me to resources on the matter.

\[For context I have a Roth IRA with Fidelity and a taxable account with M1 and Fidelity\]

1) I read that Index Funds are the way to go in regards to investing in your retirement accounts. I was thinking of doing 80% index funds and 20% stocks. I know everyone has their own style, but does that sound efficient?

2) For people whose main focus is dividend investing, did you put it in taxable account or roth? Why?Due to the Roth's tax advantages, my initial thought was to hold dividend paying stocks that I wanted to keep for the long term \[think Apple, Coke, Microsoft etc\] in my Roth IRA instead of having them in my taxable account. 

3) What are people's thoughts on \[VTI, VXUS, BND\] vs \[VOO + VXF + VEA + VWO + \[LQD + GOVT + etc\]\]? 

4) Similar to #3, what are people's thoughts on investing with Sector ETFs compared to investing in just VTI/VOO etc?

investing,"1st: this entire post is from the perspective that you have the capital available to you on Day 1, and that it’s sitting in cash. It is not from the perspective of you’re earning the cash over time (ex:. 401k contributions over your lifetime)  
Before everyone, loses it on me immediately, I actually think the psychological gains from DCA are actually worth the average loss you’d take. But it doesn’t change the fact that DCA as a methodology compared to strategy of dumping all your intended investment into an asset from Day 1 is inherently break-even (at best) or a net-loss (at-worst)  - ON AVERAGE.

  
**If you start from the assumption that the stock market tends to rise over time, waiting to put money into a stock pick is costing you money.**  Sometimes you’ll “win” and the stock will go down over that interval. Other times you’ll “lose” and the price will go up over that interval. But over many stock picks and repeat trials, on-average DCA loses more than it wins (simply due to the first sentence of this paragraph). 

  
Now, psychologically, DCA really helps. I can attest from personal experience. Here are the basic scenarios you have:  


* **Scenario #1: DCA &amp; stock goes up during period you’re buying**:
   * Psychology: You feel like you made a good pick. You’re happy. You’re not overly concerned w/ the gains you missed if you’d invested all the capital at Day 1 because you’re happy with your skill picking out a good stock
* **Scenario #2: DCA &amp; stock goes down during the period you’re buying**:
   * Psychology: You’re a bit disappointed, but you’re also comforted that you didn’t load up on Day 1. Sometimes, you feel excited, even great, that you’re now getting an even better deal on this stock than your original buy price
* **Scenario #3: All-in at Day 1  &amp; stock goes up during what would've been DCA buying period:** 
   * Psychology: You’re happy. Though not much more happy than if you’d done Scenario #1.
* **Scenario #4: All-in at Day 1  &amp; stock does down during what would’ve been DCA buying**
   * Psychology: You’re distraught. At best, upset with yourself that you mistimed your buy and left money on the table. At worst, considering panic selling. 

As you can see, in both DCA scenarios you feel pretty good about yourself. You certainly aren’t kicking yourself too hard, and if you’re in a hole it feels like one you can still climb out of.  Compare to the “All-in” scenarios, the pain of the loss aversion in scenario #4 outweighs the extra satisfaction you get in Scenario #3.

  
**In summary / TLDR:** if we were robots without emotion, and if you’re faced with the decision many times throughout your life (so you get the benefit on “on average”), you would not engage in DCA.  ",Unpopular Opinion or just Objective Fact?

It’s hard to imagine challenging [Amazon](https://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN?view=franchise)’s dominance in the e-commence space, but the coronavirus pandemic just brought Canadian start-up [Shopify](https://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SHOP-CA?view=franchise) closer to being a serious threat to the trillion-dollar juggernaut.

The Ottawa-based company is giving small businesses a fighting chance by allowing them to quickly move operations online during the forced shutdowns.

Shopify shares have been on a tear, soaring 20% in May alone and pushing its 2020 gains to more than 90%. The company also surged past Royal Bank of Canada to become Canada’s largest company by market value. The stock, which went public in May 2015, hit another all-time high on Wednesday. 

“To me, it’s a company enabling small businesses to get more in line with what the post-pandemic economy looks like,” said Dan Nathan, principal of RiskReversal Advisors.

Shopify is experiencing a surge in sales and users during these unprecedented times. Last week, Shopify reported that its sales grew by 47% to $470 million in the first quarter and continued to accelerate in April, while new stores created on the platform grew 62% in a six-week period during the pandemic. 

“We are working as fast as we can to support our merchants by re-tooling our products to help them adapt to this new reality,” Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke said in a statement last week. “Our goal is that, because Shopify exists, more entrepreneurs and small businesses will get through this.”

One of the appeals for using Shopify is that companies can sell products on their own website, instead of listing items on an Amazon-style marketplace. This month, Shopify also announced a partnership with [Pinterest](https://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PINS?view=franchise), which allows merchants to share their products to about 350 million users.",Shopify hits record as e-commerce enabler becomes ‘one of the greatest’ stock stories of all time

investing,"Hey, I started using u/Kryogenic7 Google sheets investment tracker (Great tool - thanks!). I've added my holdings into the sheet but I am unsure how to track a mutual fund holding I have in the fund.

For context, the fund is not something I periodically invest into. My grandfather left me some cash when I was 19 and my mum threw it (smartly) into the fund (performance has been good this year despite covid etc). So I'm just leaving it there for the long term (I'm still mid to late twenties).

Anyway, the fund is 100% equities split across a range of regions but I don't have a deep dive into the holdings and it would be quite a bit of work to break it out entirely. I can see the top 10 holdings, e.g. Microsoft is the highest holding at 4.8% of the fund. I can see the industry exposure by % and the region exposure by % so maybe I could use industry and region trackers/ETFs to roughly break out the fund. 

Lets say I did want to break out individual holdings and I have 4500 units of the fund at $2.50 per unit (made up figures). Would it make sense to say I have 216 (4.8% of 4500) shares of Microsoft at current market value and so on?  
The issue with this is the top 10 only makes up 26% of the fund so even if I did that it wouldn't capture the full picture, and as its a mutual fund it as actively managed so holdings subject to change.

On the other hand it is preferable to know what I am holding, e.g I already have 216 (or however many is correct) shares of MFST so this would impact a decision to buy MSFT in isolation.

This exposes a similar question about how investors track ETF holdings in thier portfolios - e.g. if 60&amp; of your stock portfolio is an S&amp;P 500 ETF how do you account for this if you wanted to purchase say Apple, Amazon, Google etc as you already have exposure through the S&amp;P?

investing,"(Bloomberg) -- NMC Health Plc’s administrators have started selling off assets of the troubled Middle Eastern hospital operator as they seek funds to pay back creditors, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Officials overseeing the process at restructuring specialist Alvarez &amp; Marsal Inc. have invited bids for NMC’s distribution business, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Potential acquirers have been asked to submit offers this month, the people said.
Administrators are planning to start a sale process for Abu Dhabi-based NMC’s lucrative fertility business as soon as June or July, the people said. They are considering eventually selling most of the company’s assets, potentially including the flagship hospital business, which is the biggest private health-care provider in the Middle East, the people said.
The moves mark the official beginning of the dismantling of NMC, once a member of London’s elite FTSE 100 index with a market value as high as $11 billion. NMC started unraveling in recent months after unearthing previously undisclosed debt and evidence of fraud, leading to the dismissal of top executives. Its downfall has roped in lenders including Barclays Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and the biggest banks in the United Arab Emirates.
Quick Process
The administrators are moving fast, asking suitors to size up the distribution business and submit proposals in a matter of days, the people said. No final decisions have been made, and there’s no certainty the discussions will lead to a transaction, they said.
A representative for NMC said the company is in the process of exploring “various options” for its distribution business, NMC Trading, “which it has determined to be non-core.”
“The management team’s priority is to stabilize the business and ensure continuity of care at its hospitals and medical centers,” the representative said in a statement. “The group’s distribution business is separate from its main hospital and medical centers business in the UAE.”
The U.K.’s Financial Reporting Council last week said it opened an investigation into Ernst &amp; Young LLP’s auditing of NMC’s 2018 financial statements. The probe started April 15 and could result in sanctions such as fines.
Medical Equipment
NMC Trading distributes products including Nestle SA food and beverages, Pfizer Inc. medicine and Unilever Plc personal-care products across the U.A.E. It also markets foreign brands of medical equipment, educational materials, office supplies and veterinary products in the country.
The business employs more than 1,700 people and distributes products to more than 10,000 points of sale including hypermarkets, gas stations and hospitals, according to information displayed on its website in March. The site was inaccessible as of Tuesday.","$NMHLY, does this mean it will soon file for bankruptcy, or it's just selling parts of the business to pay off debt with the intention/goal to resume business?"

investing,"I've started to read The Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises by Ray Dalio (You can download here: https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf) and I found the part about the phases of the classic deflationary debt cycle a very good read for the present times (Pages 16-38 on the book).

Here are my notes on the section:

As of today, we have already gone through the early part of the cycle (2009-2020), the bubble (we skipped this part in my opinion), and the top (Jan-March 2020). We are currently on the depression portion of the cycle (Which started in mid-march for the US)

The Top did not occur due to typical market forces (interest rates rising), it occurred due to an external force (COVID-19) completely stopping spending on it's tracks (This has never happened before).

The cut in interest rates to 0 on March 15 did little to 1. Produce a positive wealth effect, 2. Stimulate economic activity and 3. Ease debt-service burdens.

The onset of the depression immediately revealed cash-flow problems, which the fed eased by announcing infinite QE and the US govt eased with their first two stimulus bills. Both measures where announced and implemented throughout the last three weeks of March (fiscal policy at a slower pace than monetary policy)

According to Dalio, the policies that reduce debt burdens are the following:

1. Austerity - Although this policy was not enacted, it's happening naturally. With 3 Billion people locked at home at it's peak, we are forced to not spend as much as before. 

2. Debt defaults/restructuring - Also happening, at a slower pace than I expected. 

3. Debt Monetization / Printing - Quickly enacted through QE

4. Wealth Transfers - Not happening yet, although important voices are already signalling that it better be coming (Larry Fink)

The most ideal way out of a deflationary depression is to a 'Beautiful Deleveraging' - aka when the 4 policies above move in a harmonious way where growth grows at a faster pace than debt without inflation spiraling out of control. 

We are not even close to a beautiful deleveraging since income is decreasing at the moment while debt is increasing. 

Important point from page 32: ""People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won't if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this inflationary force.""

According to Dalio's table about well managed beautiful deleveraging on page 35, Both The Federal Reserve and the US Government have done a great job by acting quickly. However that doesn't change the fact that spending is not being stimulated, again because of an external force. 

At this point in time (And it's worth noting, Powell mentioned a variation of this today in his 9:00am video interview), The Federal Reserve is basically out of tools to get businesses and consumers to spend again. It is pretty much out of his scope. 

Monetary Policies Enacted:

MP1 - Interest Rate driven: Enacted on March 4 and March 15

MP2 - QE: Enacted from March 8 to March 23

MP3 - Putting money directly in the hands of spenders: Ongoing, but again, hard to incentivize people to spend. 

Conclusion:

I do believe we are in the depression face of a deflationary debt cycle. The Federal Reserve has done a great job through Monetary Policy so far, and the US Government has done a good job through Fiscal Policy so far. However both are running out of tools in order to solve the last piece of the puzzle: Get business and consumer to SPEND. That lands entirely on the US Government's Public Health Policy.",The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle

“The  recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time  can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems,” Powell said during  his webcast appearance with the Peterson Institute for International  Economics, according to prepared remarks.

Powell  also reiterated that the central bank would use all of its monetary  policy tools “until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is  well under way,” and suggested that Congress boost fiscal stimulus to  mitigate the risk of longer-term economic damage.

The  remarks reiterated sentiments previously expressed by other Fed  officials, many of whom acknowledged that the extended shutdowns that  have helped bring down new case growth for the virus have simultaneously  come at the expense of economic and business activity.

investing,"**TL:DR $VTIQ is the next big jumper especially after their merger this summer with Nikola Motors. They are led by a genius who has already beat Tesla once in a lawsuit over multiple patents and the numbers seem to point to an upwards trend.**

Okay boys and girls I am back and here to talk about Tesla’s ballbuster, VTIQ, or VectoIQ Acquisition. So you may be asking what this company is and let me give you a quick gist, VectoIQ is a holding company led by former **General Motors** vice chairman Steve Girsky. It has no real business of its own, but it has drawn a *lot* of interest from auto investors lately because of its plan to merge with Nikola Motors. VectoIQ's stock has had an especially strong run in the last few sessions, after the company confirmed in a series of regulatory filings that the merger is on track to close in early June. 

Now lets go over some fundamentals of this company and its soon ally Nikola Motors. First of all this company is led by Steve Girsky. Girsky joined the board of GM in July 2009 as the company emerged from a U.S. and Canadian taxpayer bailout and bankruptcy. He was a key advisor to GM’s chief executives since before the 2009 bankruptcy. Girsky led restructuring efforts at Opel, GM’s primary brand in Europe, and pushed GM executives to embrace investments in digital technology and mobile internet connectivity that the company has now made central to its product strategy. In addition to being a board member, Girsky was GM vice chairman from March 2010 to January 2014, heading up GM’s global strategy during that time. He was the chairman of the Adam Opel AG supervisory board as GM struggled to bring Opel back to profitability at a time when some of his former counterparts on Wall Street thought GM should try to sell the brand. So basically this guy knows how to lead a company and more so assist a company in developing a brand and establishing a foundation even in the most troubled of times.

Now let's get into which companies hold VTIQ and can help in pushing this company higher. We have BlackRock with 2.2 million shares and Karpus with 2.3 million shares along with 37 other investment firms trying to enjoy the ride with VTIQ too, including a retirement fund too. Now the retirement fund is interesting since 95% of the time these funds try to go with safe investments because it is for the long run, so them investing in something like this means they know how little the downside is.

Now Nikola Motors is poised to be going into a brawl with the great all knowing Elon Musk, but thing is they have already won round one. Almost two years ago, Nikola Motors surprised the trucking market by filing a $2 billion lawsuit alleging that the Tesla Semi copied several design elements from the Nikola One, the truck-maker’s flagship hydrogen long hauler. News about the patent lawsuit has been scarce for over a year, but recent updates indicate that Nikola has snatched a small victory from the Silicon Valley-based electric car maker. Nikola’s case listed several characteristics of the One that were allegedly copied by Tesla. These included the Semi’s wraparound windshield, mid-entry door, front fenders, and the all-electric truck’s aerodynamic shape. To highlight its point, Nikola stated that the similar drag coefficient between the One (0.37) and the Semi (0.36) was further proof that the battery electric long hauler was copied from the hydrogen fuel-cell sleeper cab. 

Excerpts from Nikola’s lawsuit pointed out that the Semi’s design had caused confusion among the One’s customers, diverting sales from the hydrogen truck maker to Tesla. Nikola also argued that these confusions might result in the Semi’s problems being attributed to the One, such as those resulting from Tesla’s batteries and Autopilot software.

Well here was the ruling on that: **Tesla loses bid to invalidate Nikola Motor patents in USPTO dispute. USPTO not only upheld Nikola semi truck's important patents but refused Tesla's request to modify our patents. Two billion dollar lawsuit moving forward. We will defend our company's IP no matter who it is.**

And last but not least let's get into the numbers. VTIQ has moved up significantly in the past month and is seeming to not be slowing down in any sense. With the MACD set to a 2.1 and 1.0 difference with the RSI being still lower than their previous March jump, they seem to have a huge jump left to be had. As of recently they had a 13 million volume which is still 5 million less than their highest volume level of 18 million so it seems like there is a lot of money left to be made.

investing,"https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead

&gt;Let’s start with the very basics. Below is a chart of the value spread (the ratio of how “expensive” expensive stocks are vs. cheap stocks – a chart we sometimes call “the value of value”).10
   See here or here if you need a refresher. These value spread analyses require decisions both on which value factor is used and how its attractiveness is measured. The simplest choice, and the one that aligns best with the academic and practitioner literature, is to use price-to-book sorting (the HML factor) and to evaluate it with a matching value spread based on price-to-book. This is indeed what I show in many of the charts below, but the tables will also report value spreads using multiple value measures for these price-to-book sorted portfolios. The idea is to stay reasonably consistent with the literature but also to check that price-to-book is not driving the bus (the major exception for using price-to-book sorting is one later chart where I study a price-to-sales sorted portfolio as a robustness check11
  ). In Figure 1, following Fama and French, I use the whole U.S. stock universe and do not exclude industries nor neutralize industry exposures.12
  


/

&gt;So the expensive stocks are sometimes only &lt;4x as expensive as the cheap stocks, the median is that they are 5.4x more expensive, but today they are almost 12x more expensive. For those first-time listeners, 12x is a lot! Here are some stats we’ll use repeatedly. It is now (March 31, 2020) at the 100th percentile vs. the 50+ years of history we have.13
   Another stat I like to examine is the amount the current reading is over median, divided by the maximum ever reading over median. This complements the percentile as it includes magnitude. Sometimes the 97th percentile is pretty close to the maximum ever, sometimes it’s further away. Here, again obviously, this measure is now at 100% (when you’re at the 100th percentile there is no difference in these measures). Finally, while it’s a somewhat flawed statistic for an autocorrelated and somewhat skewed series, I’ll report the standard deviation event (STD) of the final reading largely to compare across our various tests. Here it’s +4.5. 

/

&gt;C. Excluding Certain Stocks Doesn’t Change the Story

Using measures other than price-to-book should help a lot if price-to-book is flawed. But we can do better. Now we are going to systematically throw out stocks based on a variety of criteria. For instance, today we would like to examine the value spread versus history if you didn’t include the likes of, say, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, or Tesla (MAGFANT). But we can’t throw just those, and only those, out today as it’s arbitrary and causes an apples-to-oranges problem when comparing to the past. We need to find systematic ways of tossing stocks we worry might be hard to value today that we can apply consistently over the whole 50+ years. I try three (and mention some others in the footnotes).

/

I show what my colleagues show but in a different, more brute-force but perhaps even clearer way, and come to the same strong conclusion. Value is super cheap today and this is not coming from only the potentially “broken” price-to-book measure (it isn’t even very dependent on it) nor is it due to a group of winner-take-all monopolistic companies. It is not coming exclusively from the tech industries, it is not coming from mega-caps, and it is not coming from the most expensive stocks. Rather it is a pervasive phenomenon.43
   Investors are simply paying way more than usual for the stocks they love versus the ones they hate (and measured using our most realistic implementation this is the clear maximum they’ve ever paid) and doing it in a highly diversified way up and down the cross-section of stocks.

investing,,"With the fed buying into them, Does it make sense to purchase bond ETFs?"
investing,"It is generally accepted that the best thing to do is to invest in broad-market index funds. It generally greatly reduces the volatility and it almost taken for granted that it will rise over time.  

In. Oral market environments, investing in „the“ market probably makes sense. But given the worldwide coronavirus fallout, we currently have an increasingly clear picture about the market as a whole and about the sectors that are hardest hit.

Investing in  road market funds currently exposes you to many sectors that we know are going to have an extremely difficult time. Here are just a few examples:

- Airlines

- Cruise Lines 

- commercial plane manufacturers

- hotels

- restaurant chains 

- oil sector

-  Recreation/leisure

Why would it make sense to invest in say the S&amp;P 500 if we know it includes probably at least 100 companies in sectors that are currently hardest hit?

I think now is the time to chose the winners, wo chose the companies that prosper in this current environment. It seems silly to get weighed down by the oil sector given the fact that demand for oil will likely take years to reach pre-corona levels.

Isn’t right now the perfect time to pick individual stocks?

investing,"Hello everyone,

I think this situation is common for many people lately: In these days I am considering starting a general investment plan with an eventual accumulation plan on [Moneyfarm](https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/). Ideal plan: start with a deposit of 10-15k (maybe in separate installments over 3-5 months to diversify more) and leave it alone for 15-25 years (when I'll be 40-50 years old). At the same time, I am considering to invest on my own on Degiro or Directa (for Italy). I made a quick calculation, not counting the ETFs that have no fees. Considering my starting budget of 10-15k, the fee costs would be around 250-400€ for the inital buy of 7 ETFs. Each subsequent year, I would like to add a budget of 2.4k as part of the accumulation plan, so my annual fees should then amount to 90-130€ + ETFs costs for 7-14 entries per year (1-2 entries per year for 7 ETFs). This annual cost would be more or less the same of MoneyFarm (1% per year on capital + ETF costs). Of course this calculation is not considering the ETFs that you can buy without fees, which would drastically make my DIY option a lot cheaper, but I made the calculation anyway since I don't know which ETFs are best for my situation.

Looking at JustETF, I realized that I don't have the basis for making a precise and safe asset allocation. I'm not a beginner in finance/economy and I know a few things, but as I said I don't feel ready. On paper I know how to diversify and other principles, but then when it comes to the concrete knowledge I simply which specific ETFs I could use to build my portfolio. The only thing that I know is I want accumulative type ETFs and I want them to be ""reliable"".

So I was wondering, how long does it take to learn how to correctly build a serious portfolio? Moneyfarm seems like a reliable option that builds a portfolio with professional and well-kept criteria, and chooses the right financial instruments. Considering this comparison, how long would it take for me to do a job like theirs on my own? We are talking about savings that I would like to grow over time and not squander through poor choices. Lastly, where can I cultivate my knowledge about ETFs? Also, should I consider a pension fund instead of this..?

Does it also mean that investing in these bonds yourself is a bad idea because the interest rates will be low? Wouldn't this sort of be the Fed ""squeezing"" out regular investors meaning that if they pull out things could turn sour as suddenly there are not enough normal people available to fill the bond needs of the market?  


On the flip side does it mean you should attempt to lock in your mortgage by putting it fixed on these low rates to take advantage of it? Should you also expect home prices to not actually drop that much because the low interest rates mean people feel like they can borrow more?

Having trouble posting a picture of the table but for reference it’s on pg 173

Here are some statistics from the past 10 market cycles starting in 1948

- From “peak of stock index” to the “peak of the business cycle” on average is usually 5.7 months with a range of 0-13 months 

- Between the “peak of stock index” and “peak of the business cycle” there is on average an 8.21% drop with a range of 0%-22.94% 

- Average decline in the 12 following months 17.47% with a range of 8.65%-38.80% 

I understand these are unusual times that may change our market cycle because of the following reasons. 

- Unlimited QE
- Coronavirus 
- Stay at home orders

Along with a few of factors but you get the point

Facts

- Spy peaked at 339.08 on 19 Feb 2020 (3 months ago)
- Spy is down 15.45% from its all time high 
- There’s an insane amount of factors that point towards a stock market decline 

As I said earlier I understand that times are different but history is pointing towards a bear market in the coming months ( my guess is mid June).

investing,"This is hypothetical.  I've been investing for a long time and read a lot, so I know not to time the market and all the other rules of thumb that we follow.  


I'm trying to work out the math if I sold $100k stock right now and what the financial benefit would be in the long run.

**ASSUMPTIONS:**

My profit would be $60k.  Tax rate 22%

Market will drop 25% in the near future.  After that it will rise 4% a year for 5 years.

**SCENARIO 1: Hold the money**

I sell the $100k and pay $13,200 tax, leaving me with $86,800 (profit of $46,800.)  Not bad.  I could put it aside for home improvement.  I am now out of the market.  


**SCENARIO 2: Reinvest if the market drops**   
The market drops 25%.  I re-invest my $86,800.

Market rises 4% a year for 5 years.  I now have $105,600.

&amp;#x200B;

**SCENARIO 3: Do nothing**

I hold my $100k. The market drops 25%.  I now have $75,000.

Market rises 4% a year for 5 years.  I now have $91,248.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY:**

Is it right that Scenario 2 gives me an advantage of $14,352 ($105,600 - $91.238) over Scenario 3?

It somehow feels like I should be benefitting more than that.  Am I overlooking something?  


I guess my advantage in Scenario 2 gets greater if the market drops more and vice versa.",What if I sell all my stock? (help me work through the math)
investing,"Hey guys!  First post here because I'm hoping a better understanding of this can help me in future years to make the best decision for myself and my family.  My wife and I just got married in October and both make over $10,000 a year (important later, I promise).  Since this is our first time filing taxes as a couple, I tried to see what our returns would be filing separately vs jointly.  Turns out we would have gotten an extra $600 back filing separately, mostly in state tax return.  Or so I thought until I added in my ROTH IRA contributions.  For whatever weird reason, married filing separately has an income cap of $10,000 in order to contribute to a ROTH without a 6% penalty, enforced every year until the money is removed from the account??  And even if you contribute to a traditional, it may end up not be tax-deductible?  What is this about? Outside of preventing couples in similar situations from filing separately to increase their tax return, what is the point of this?  For context, married filing jointly and filing as single both have income caps in excess of $100,000 for ROTH IRA contributions.

investing,"Stan Druckenmiller said the risk-reward calculation for equities is the worst he’s seen in his career, and that the government stimulus programs won’t be enough to overcome real world economic problems.

“The consensus out there seems to be: ‘Don’t worry, the Fed has your back,’” said Druckenmiller on Tuesday during a webcast held by The Economic Club of New York. “There’s only one problem with that: our analysis says it’s not true.”

While traders think there is “massive” liquidity and that the stimulus programs are big enough to solve the problems facing the U.S., the economic effects of the coronavirus are likely to be long lasting and will lead to a slew of bankruptcies, he said.

“I pray I’m wrong on this, but I just think that the V-out is a fantasy,” the legendary hedge fund manager said, referring to a V-shaped recovery.

Druckenmiller’s remarks are among the strongest comments yet by a Wall Street heavyweight on the bleak outlook facing the U.S. They also stand in contrast to the optimism that has pushed the S&amp;P 500 Index to rally almost 30% since its March low even as the pandemic has brought the economy to a standstill, seized up credit markets and ended the longest bull market in history.

The damage spurred the Federal Reserve to unveil a raft of emergency lending programs and Congress to unleash almost $3 trillion in stimulus funds. But those programs aren’t likely to spur future economic growth, Druckenmiller said.

“It was basically a combination of transfer payments to individuals, basically paying them more not to work than to work,” he said. “And in addition to that, it was a bunch of payments to zombie companies to keep them alive.”

Druckenmiller said he thinks that the current liquidity will soon shrink as U.S. Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases.

Druckenmiller, 66, the former chief strategist for George Soros, converted his hedge fund into Duquesne Family Office in 2010. His long-term track record, making returns of about 30% a year over three decades, established him as one of the world’s top money mangers. He has an estimated net worth of $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Like other investors and Wall Street executives, Druckenmiller agrees that the pandemic will lead to more regulation and higher taxes.

Other highlights from the Druckenmiller interview:

In the future, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak becomes the “poster child for the worst public policy decisions ever made from a cost-benefit analysis.”
On a relative basis, he’s as bullish on long-short strategies as he’s been in 10 years. “That’s partly because I’m worried about everything else,” he said.
Druckenmiller was also bullish on Amazon.com Inc., saying people should be thankful that the company exists right now given the number of jobs created. He also praised its transition to less profitable, essential-needs products without raising prices.",Druckenmiller Says Risk-Reward in Stocks Is Worst He’s Seen

investing,"[Manhattan Faces a Reckoning if Working From Home Becomes the Norm](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/nyregion/coronavirus-work-from-home.html)

&gt; Before the coronavirus crisis, three of New York City’s largest commercial tenants — Barclays, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley — had tens of thousands of workers in towers across Manhattan. Now, as the city wrestles with when and how to reopen, executives at all three firms have decided that it is highly unlikely that all their workers will ever return to those buildings.

&gt; The research firm Nielsen has arrived at a similar conclusion. Even after the crisis has passed, its 3,000 workers in the city will no longer need to be in the office full-time and can instead work from home most of the week.

&gt; The real estate company Halstead has 32 branches across the city and region. But its chief executive, who now conducts business over video calls, is mulling reducing its footprint.

...

&gt; **The number of workers who actually prefer to be in an office because of the opportunity for social interaction is an unknown factor.**

&gt; Still, when the dust settles, New York City could face a real estate reckoning.

&gt; David Kenny, the chief executive at Nielsen, said the company plans to convert its New York offices to team meeting spaces where workers gather maybe once or twice a week.

I've been thinking for a while that WFH-capable businesses will move to some hybrid of WFH while being in the office a few times a week. 

&gt; **Twitter, which has hundreds of employees in its New York office in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, told all its employees on Tuesday that they could work remotely forever if they want to and if their position allows for it.**

&gt; Entire economies were molded around the vast flow of people to and from offices, from the rush-hour schedules of subways, buses and commuter rails to the construction of new buildings to the survival of corner bodegas. Restaurants, bars, grocery stores and shops depend on workers for their survival.

&gt; **Real estate taxes provide about a third of New York’s revenue, helping pay for basic services like the police, trash pickup and street repairs.** Falling tax revenue would worsen the city’s financial crisis and hinder its recovery.

So I have some questions on this:

1) How do y'all feel commercial real estate and tax bases will be affected?

2) Which companies are best positioned under a possible evolution to WFH?

Personally, I don't think everyone will or even can work from home. However, even a chunk of workers doing so should have a large impact on commercial real estate and the broader economy.",NYT: Manhattan Faces a Reckoning if Working From Home Becomes the Norm
investing,"Good evening everyone,

I’m curious to know what everyone’s investing goals are compared to what mine are. 

I currently trade my Rollover IRA that has $9,205.86 in it. One year ago, my account value was $6,033.20. A 52% return. 

My highest account value this year was $13,361.66. I took out $2,000 pre market decline for a new place, and my account low this year was $5894.58. 

I guess that’s all really irrelevant information, but just wanted everyone to have an idea of what my past year has been like.

Strong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:

1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.
2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.
3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19****.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.
4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.
5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.** South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore, research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms. 

**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.",5/12 Weekly Update and Expectations

**Coronavirus is not going away, and will continue to destroy the economy**

* We have flattened the curve, but we have not dramatically decreased the number of new cases. After increasing exponentially throughout the month of March, new cases [peaked](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-cases-covid-19?country=USA) at the beginning of April, plateauing at about 25,000-35,000 new cases daily. Since then, new cases have trended down, but not dramatically. We are still reporting 18,000-25,000 new cases daily. This is a bad sign. Social distancing orders have clearly stopped the exponential phase of the virus, but they haven’t been able to fully contain it. Which brings me to my next point.

* Social distancing cannot last forever. It has been deteriorating for a while, and will continue to do so. People are able to tolerate staying at home and avoiding activity for a few weeks. After a few weeks, though, they get antsy. The biggest problem with social distancing is that when it’s successful, it will have felt like a waste of time. People see that a few hundred, maybe a couple thousand people have died from coronavirus in their state. That’s obviously bad, but is it really worth destroying small businesses and sending unemployment skyrocketing? Why should I be staying inside when this coronavirus isn’t that dangerous anyway? This seems like an overreaction, they will think. The problem is that the reason coronavirus isn’t killing huge numbers of people, is because stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures have prevented it from doing so. If the cure is successful, it will have seemed unnecessary. 

* Political pressure builds on governors to ease lockdowns. We have seen this in Georgia, Texas, Florida, and many other states. It is political suicide to maintain lockdowns perpetually; governors are forced to at the very least loosen them. Even if governors maintain strict social distancing orders, people will begin to violate them more and more as they grow impatient. This is borne out in phone data, which [shows](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/01/849161820/mobile-phone-data-show-more-americans-are-leaving-their-homes-despite-orders) people have begun to spend less time at home recently. 

* It is clear that people social distancing autonomously as well as stay-at-home orders are what decreased the virus’ R0 and stopped the exponential phase in early April. As people begin to take more risks and as social distancing measures are lifted, it seems obvious to me that the R0 will increase. Even a small change in R0 has an enormous effect on the course of the virus. If decreased social distancing raises R0 from 0.95 to 1.2, the virus goes from dying out to growing exponentially. I see almost no way that the US doesn’t begin to see an increase in the number of new cases daily over the next month or two, given that our current measures are having a disappointingly small effect and that these measures will only become weaker as time goes on.

* It seems obvious to me that we are headed for a return to the exponential stage relatively soon. This second wave makes logical sense, and [appeared](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif) during the 1918 flu pandemic. If anyone can provide a counterargument, I would love to hear it. 

* Now, some of you might say that this is actually a good thing, because coronavirus really isn’t that dangerous, so the young and healthy should get back to work. There are problems with this. The [New York antibody test](https://www.livescience.com/covid-antibody-test-results-new-york-test.html) suggested an infection fatality rate of about 0.5%. This has two big implications. Firstly, the virus is less deadly than we initially thought. However, it isn’t drastically less deadly. If 250 million Americans contract the virus and 0.5% of them die, that’s about 1.3 million dead people. That is a lot of people. I know some people believed that the virus was far less deadly than we thought, with an IFR of .1% or something, but that unfortunately isn’t true. Secondly, this study implies that there is no degree of herd immunity in the United States yet. Some coronavirus optimists have suggested that a large portion of the US may already be infected. It is certainly true that there are more people who have had it than our official case numbers indicate. But if we divide our 83,000 deaths by this 0.5% death rate, we get 17 million cases--a lot, to be sure, but only about 5% of the US population. If R0 is 1.5, the inflection point will come when 33% of the population is infected; if it is 2, 50% must be infected.

* This post is way longer than I intended it to be. My basic point is that the coronavirus outbreak will worsen. As a result of this, our economy will continue to hobble along at reduced capacity for far longer than anticipated. We can’t just go back to normal as long as COVID threatens us. [More than half](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/upshot/pandemic-economy-government-orders.html?rref=upshot&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=The%20Upshot&amp;pgtype=Multimedia) of people would not eat at a restaurant, go to a mall, or ride an airplane. The phrase I’ve heard most these past few weeks is “the stock market is not the economy.” That is true, but the stock market does not exist in a vacuum. It is tied to fundamentals, and as the fundamentals worsen, the stock market will go down. I expect a major drawdown to begin sometime in the next month or two. I don’t know how long the market can stay irrational. In the interest of space, I cut out my thoughts on the connection between a worsening outbreak and the economy and the market, so the lack of analysis on that is intentional, not an oversight. If people disagree with this, I would love to hear so I can confront flaws in my thinking.

(Bloomberg) -- George Soros has a $66 million stake in DraftKings Inc., one of several big-name investors to receive shares in the sports-betting company through a deal that took it public last month.

Quantum Partners, an investment vehicle run by Soros Fund Management, holds 2.7 million DraftKings Class A shares, according to a filing last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Soros Fund Management, which oversees investments on behalf of the 89-year-old philanthropist and his family.

DraftKings has expanded its investor base beyond the sports world as it competes in the growing market for legal online wagering. The company, which began in 2012 as a fantasy-sports platform, drew startup investments from Major League Baseball as well as Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft, owners of the National Football League’s Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, respectively, prior to the reverse merger last month with blank-check company Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp.

Soros Fund Management, which oversees roughly $25 billion, has been investing more conservatively under Dawn Fitzpatrick, its chief investment officer since 2017. But the firm made at least one other opportunistic investment amid the coronavirus pandemic, disclosing last quarter that it held 2.7 million shares of Peloton Interactive Inc., the supplier of upscale stationary bikes and related online workout programs. The stock has since soared 58%, lifting the value of the stake to $117 million.

DraftKings is up 40% since the Boston-based company went public through a reverse merger on April 23. Mousse Partners, the family office that invests the Chanel fortune for the Wertheimers, holds $88 million in shares, the filing shows. Michael Gordon, a former money manager with Jeffrey Vinik’s hedge fund, has a stake of almost $20 million.

Kraft’s DraftKings holding is larger than that of his NFL rival, according to the filing. Kraft and his sons Jonathan and Daniel own 3.53 million shares while Legends Hospitality, an investment vehicle set up by the Cowboys and the New York Yankees, has 194,867.

Several owners of pro-basketball teams are also listed as investors in DraftKings for the first time.

Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp., controlled by the Dolan family that owns the New York Knicks, indirectly has almost 1.5 million shares. Stephen Pagliuca, co-chairman of Bain Capital and a co-owner of the Boston Celtics, has about 566,000 shares through a partnership with Anastasios Parafestas, the head of Bollard Group.

Representatives for the investors either declined to comment or didn’t return telephone calls.

He places a €100 banknote on the counter, and goes to the first floor to find a room.

Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is ""priced in"".

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout

This is a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap). There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period.

Welcome to the **debt bubble**! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...

* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance
* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt
* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE
* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand
* **Wage increase** will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble

investing,"Let me start by saying, I don't think these books, or others like it are ""bullshit"" or have no value. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe books like these are great for putting you into a money-making mode, they did give me motivation and it's because of these books that I am seeking further knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, I'm Brazilian, am a barber, I don't believe in college/university. I have no money, I have no assets, and my country isn't as awesome as America. I say this to point out the following. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go to college, or hardcore change my life-style. I like barbering, I like my routine, I feel like it's the first time in my life where I'm being a man about everything that happens to me, and that's making me grow as a person like never before. I'm happy for the first time in my life about who I am, and what I'm doing. I don't want to change something that's been a positive in my life. I've always been on the other side, always negative, always unhappy with my situation in life. So why change what's working.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm healthier mentally than I've ever been, but I read something someone said about these books here on Reddit, and despite not agreeing with him that these are just snake-oil, I do agree that if I did indeed have a millionaire mind, I'd already be growing rich. Men like him don't have to read self-help books, or learn how to get into a money-making mindset. This guy claimed to have taken a loan when he was 21, invested it in a small food cart, and through paying, and investing, and loaning more, he's now living comfortably, making a lot more money than I'd ever dream of.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the difference between a guy like that and me? Lets say everything he said is true. Why can't I take out a loan, and start a lil cheap thing too, and grow it, sell it, loan more money, invest in something bigger, make more, and more and more just like him? I think I have the same capacity to earn in that manner, but I'm not feeling like books like these are what I need.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of knowledge do I need in order to be able to make these kinds of decisions with confidence? What did I need to know, before I go to the bank and take a 20k loan? What do I need to learn so that I can apply that 20k loan into something that'll make me 25k, or 30k,or 40k back in the shortest amount of time?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mind working at all, but I don't want to toil away day in, day out in an office, living paycheck to paycheck, waiting a lifetime to get a few crumbs off the pie.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I need to know to make the decisions that people who make money do?

The price quoted in the stock exchange is the price that people are willing to buy that share for. For example, someone might wake up one day and say I want to sell my share below market price and that would drive price down. 

Therefore, company performance is not directly linked to share price performance. Investor speculation is directly linked to it. 

So, why should companies be held responsible for their stock price performance when it is not directly in their control? 

They should instead be held accountable for things which are in their control, such as earnings and payout to investors through dividends.

Uber recently made a takeover approach for Grubhub - while the transactions is still under review at the board level - it begs the question is Uber shifting the business model from ride sharing to delivery - at least in the short term.

A good proof point is that the April SAAR, which is annualized US auto sales of new vehicles was \~8M, 50% down from it's peak - unlike the 80% drop in auto sales as people had expected. This is primarily because of people buying their vehicles and not depending on ride sharing going forward.

investing," Greetings,

I have recently dumped about $40,000 in a 50/50 ratio of VRE (Vanguard REIT ETF) and BPY (Brookfield Property Partners) in my TFSA. The rationale is that REITs are best held in a tax-sheltered account due to their diverse distributions and troubled accounting during tax season. Also, despite BPY being 1 company, they are globally diversified, which provides me with some level of diversification outside of Canada.

I have a long time horizon (looking to hold for 10+ years or even 20 years), and might draw from the dividends from time to time if needed (hence leaving them in a TFSA). So it's like owning a little real estate empire in my TFSA.

My questions are:

1. What are your thoughts on this method? Yes I know it's extremely undiversified, but I will be diversifying in global stocks in my RRSP, and Canadian dividend stocks in my margin account. My goal here is not diversification, but to concentrate on real estate and maximum yield.
2. I've also been eyeing RIT (CI First Asset REIT ETF), and bought some on my other account. It seems to have historically outperformed all the popular REIT ETFs (ZRE, XRE, VRE), albeit with a rather high management fee. I chose VRE over RIT due to half the MER cost, but it seems like the performance of RIT might be significant enough to justify the MER. Would you pick RIT over VRE? Why or why not?

Very roughly speaking from looking online at a number of high yield dividend stocks it seems they pay out on average $3-$4 yearly per stock. Those stocks sell at around $60-$150.

It’s very diverse with 104 holdings in different sectors (over 40% of its holdings are in the Tech sector).  In 10 years from its IPO, it peaked at over 6,400% gains, and even during the bottom of the current crash, over 10 years, it was still up over 2,000%.  I don’t see it dropping to 0 during a recession with only a .95% expense ratio. I only see negative articles about holding leveraged ETFs long term, but the results have proved otherwise.

The Bloomberg article will likely be paywalled so I've pasted it here:

&gt;The Trump administration moved on Monday night to block investments in Chinese stocks by a government retirement savings fund.  
&gt;  
&gt;National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien made the administration’s wishes known in a letter to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, according to a person familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The move was made as President Donald Trump, as recently as a press conference on Monday, has faulted China over the spread of the coronavirus, and as questions have arisen over how faithfully the Beijing government will adhere to a recent trade agreement between the two countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scalia then sent a letter to Michael Kennedy, the chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, telling him to “halt all steps” associated with putting government employees’ money in a fund that included stakes in Chinese companies, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg News.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Thrift Savings Plan -- the federal government’s retirement savings fund -- was scheduled to transfer roughly $50 billion of its international fund to mirror an MSCI All Country World Index, which captures emerging markets, including China.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board oversees the fund and made a decision in 2017 that the money should be moved by mid-2020. Opponents of the transfer in recent weeks have engaged in a last-minute effort to stop it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scalia said that O’Brien and Kudlow had “expressed grave concerns with the planned investment on grounds of both investment risk and national security.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“As you know, the concerns expressed in this letter have been voiced by both Republican and Democratic members of Congress,” Scalia wrote in his letter to Kennedy.  
&gt;  
&gt;The letter to Scalia was reported earlier by Fox Business Network.

There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy, things were just messed up because a bunch of bankers f'd up and didn't understand what they were doing.  As a result, the market dropped, but it was just perception: there were still lots of jobs and the real economy was doing well.  It made sense to inject some money to overcome the disjoint between the real and financial economies which would have caused companies to fail and people to lose jobs.

This time is different.  Now, because of our reaction to a virus, millions are already out of work and thousands of companies are, or soon will be, out of business.  Without jobs, and with the changes in people's spending habits, the real economy will struggle to recover and may take decades.

People buy bonds to hedge vs. equity. Should allocation to bonds be lower, given the lower expected return of bonds? If you have a targeted return for your portfolio, this seems to make sense. But what else would you buy if equity is still too risky?

&gt;Consumer prices in April took their biggest drop in history going back to at least 1957 as the economy reeled from restrictions imposed to control the coronavirus.

&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday that the CPI excluding food and energy prices slumped 0.4%, the steepest monthly drop since records have been kept.

&gt;While the decline in prices was broad-based, the biggest swoons in the “core” part of the index came in apparel and transportation services, which dropped 4.7% apiece. Commodities not including food and energy fell 0.7% and medical care services prices were off 0.5%. Used cars saw a 0.4% decline amid a slide in auto sales.

&gt;Big drops within the categories were car and truck rentals (-16.6%), airline fares (-15.2%) and men’s suits (-11.3%).

&gt;On a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 1.4%, the smallest move since April 2011.

&gt;The moves come amid a series of fiscal and monetary moves aimed at juicing economic activity. Rescue efforts from both sides have been unprecedented in dollar amount and breadth, but come amid an economy frozen in place that will see a drop in GDP for the second quarter that will be unparalleled. 

&gt;The Federal Reserve continues to pump money into the economy amid a deflationary threat and an unemployment situation at its worst point since the Great Depression.

&gt;“The Federal Reserve should be more worried about deflation, when prices are falling broadly in the economy, rather than inflation, when prices are rising. If deflation becomes embedded in the economy, it can be difficult to uproot,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. “If prices are falling, consumers and businesses may wait to make purchases, assuming that prices will be even lower in the future; this can exacerbate economic downturns.”

&gt;Headline CPI, which included huge drops in energy but big jumps in food costs, fell 0.8% and was up just 0.3% from a year ago. The index for cereals and bakery products, for instance, rose 2.9% in April for its largest monthly increase ever.
Food at home prices increased 2.6% as part of a broader 1.5% move higher in the overall category. A number of categories saw major spikes as Americans came under stay-at-home orders. 
Energy prices were off 10.1% for the month, due in part to a 20.6% plunge in gasoline.",Core consumer prices saw the largest monthly drop ever in April

investing,"**My background and goals:**

I have a steady income which I was aggressively saving and that money were put into ETF index funds (VTI/BND 80:20 ratio) for over 5 years. After that, I have started to put money more into quality dividend paying companies with good fundaments (mostly Dividend Aristocrats/Dividend Champions / Dividend Contenders). This is what I did in the last 2 years. 

My current situation is that I have transferred all my portfolio from ETF funds into dividend-paying stocks. I don't need to withdraw anything from my stock portfolio for the next 10 years minimum. I am working and still contributing to my investment account from my salary (not as much as before, but still 30-40% of my net salary).

**My questions:**

1) What are the benefits of dividend investing over passive ETF investing? You have to be extremely skillfull / educated and involved / lucky to actually beat the results of ETF fund like VTI in the long run. (not to mention your time invested). 

2) I have played with the numbers and it seems that I cannot beat the performance of VTI (or VTI/BND)  with quality dividend companies. See following example (which is similar to my portfolio): 

 [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2010&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VTI&amp;allocation1\_1=80&amp;symbol2=BND&amp;allocation2\_1=20&amp;allocation2\_2=20&amp;symbol3=VT&amp;allocation3\_2=80&amp;symbol4=ABBV&amp;allocation4\_3=8&amp;symbol5=BEN&amp;allocation5\_3=14&amp;symbol6=BNS&amp;allocation6\_3=5&amp;symbol7=CCL&amp;allocation7\_3=6&amp;symbol8=ENB&amp;allocation8\_3=6&amp;symbol9=GILD&amp;allocation9\_3=6&amp;symbol10=MO&amp;allocation10\_3=10&amp;symbol11=RDS.B&amp;allocation11\_3=12&amp;symbol12=T&amp;allocation12\_3=7&amp;symbol13=WFC&amp;allocation13\_3=12&amp;symbol14=XOM&amp;allocation14\_3=14](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2010&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VTI&amp;allocation1_1=80&amp;symbol2=BND&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;allocation2_2=20&amp;symbol3=VT&amp;allocation3_2=80&amp;symbol4=ABBV&amp;allocation4_3=8&amp;symbol5=BEN&amp;allocation5_3=14&amp;symbol6=BNS&amp;allocation6_3=5&amp;symbol7=CCL&amp;allocation7_3=6&amp;symbol8=ENB&amp;allocation8_3=6&amp;symbol9=GILD&amp;allocation9_3=6&amp;symbol10=MO&amp;allocation10_3=10&amp;symbol11=RDS.B&amp;allocation11_3=12&amp;symbol12=T&amp;allocation12_3=7&amp;symbol13=WFC&amp;allocation13_3=12&amp;symbol14=XOM&amp;allocation14_3=14) 

3) So why should I bother with spending my time researching dividend stocks to produce suboptimal results of my portfolio? An example from portfolio visualiser above clearly shows that VTI (or VTI/BND) clearly outperforms my portfolio consisting of high quality dividend paying stocks.

4) And yet - many people prefer dividend strategy over ETF strategy while still in accumulating phase of their life (that means they don't need those dividends  now) Why is that? Wouldnt they have better results with passive ETF approach?

5) In my situation, described above, is there any logical reason why I should stick with dividend investing over ETF passive investing strategy? What is the optimal approach?

**Jacko's Switches**

Stock market gorilla Jacko randomly exchanges a share from his portfolio every month for a new share from one of Amsterdam's three main indices. These shares, too, are randomly selected. The amount released by the sale is fully invested in the new share.

Jacko started investing in January 2000. At that time Jacko received 75 bananas, all of which corresponded to a fund listed on the Dutch stock exchange. The first ten bananas (corresponding to shares) formed his portfolio.

Since then, Jacko randomly exchanges one share from his portfolio with a new share on a monthly basis, using bananas. The completely random choice of shares is central to this. After all, there is no information about the corresponding share in the bananas.

Jacko's analysis and stock/banana picking in action:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xujc2TkTYrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xujc2TkTYrM)

Today is a big day for the central bank, which will buy corporate bonds for the first time in its history. Its corporate bond-buying program was announced in March, as part of a package of pandemic rescue measures.

The Fed will start with bond E.T.F.s. Most purchases will be in funds that hold investment-grade debt, the central bank said, but it will dabble in junk bonds. Direct purchases of corporate debt will follow.

• The program, which is managed by BlackRock, will take $75 billion in equity from the Treasury and leverage it 10-to-1, giving it up to $750 billion to play with.",NYT: Fed to start buying ETFs

I am not an experienced trader and don't know much about stocks. However, I had some shares in Norwegian Air, and apparently they are issuing new stocks to raise money so they can get government support.

* *The central bank's Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will begin purchases today of eligible exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt, seeing the method as a fast way to direct money into the credit markets.*
* *The program, managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), centers around investment grade corporate bonds, though some will be high-yield.*
* *Another Fed facility designed to buy debt directly from issuers, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, is set to launch ""in the near future.""*

I suppose in current uncertain macro environment, community would appreciate a lot, if someone who knows more about bond markets could possibly try to evaluate how this milestone of a step could influence equities for example. How likely is it that somewhere down the line they will also start buying equity ETFs?

Is it reasonable to feel even angry, that FED is apparently also going for high-yield bonds, which in my simple mind at least means, that those who took on greater risk and therefore were rewarded with high yielding rates in return of taking on the risk, now basically get somewhat of a bailout?

investing,"**Summary:** Allogene is a \~$4B market cap clinical stage biotech company developing allogeneic (‘off the shelf’) CAR-T therapies for hematologic cancers and solid tumor indications. Allogene was founded in 2018 by Arie Belldegrun and David Chang, who previously led Kite Pharma to the Yescarta approval and an $11.9 B acquisition by Gilead. While the current high price point presents risks, 2020 will be a critical year for Allogene with multiple early-stage readouts: this presents an opportunity to ride several key value inflection points over the next 6 - 12 months

**Key Takeaways**

* There is a lot to like about the experience the Allogene team brings to the table and the promise of their platform to address the clinical and commercial shortcomings of current marketed CAR-T therapies
* Allogene plans to initiate an abbreviated P1 trial for ALLO-501A in 2Q20 to confirm the results of the ALLO-501 P1 ALPHA trial, results for which will be presented this month at ASCO, prior to potentially advancing ALLO-501A to pivotal P2 development
* If the lead program in NHL (ALLO-501/ALLO-501A) is successful, that represents in the range of 100% upside using Kite Pharma, another CAR-T company, as an analogue
* Kite Pharma was valued at $8.4B prior to the Gilead acquisition with a filed BLA in NHL for Yescarta, double what Allogene is trading at today: given a high PTRS for Allogene’s program in NHL (rationale outlined below), this represents directionally where we would expect Allogene’s value to land in the future
* However, current market cap of &gt;$4 B constrains achievable upside versus the downside risk if near-term value clinical catalysts go against our expectation

*We are taking a modest (1 - 2% of portfolio) position ahead of the two key clinical readouts on 5/13 and 5/29 given our expectation for positive P1 results for ALLO-501 (ALPHA trial) and the 2Q20 initiation of P1/P2 ALPHA2 trial for ALLO-501A based on the following:*

* Strong preliminary P1 safety and efficacy data was presented in 2018 by for UCART19 in ALL, which is the same molecular design as ALLO-501 
* ALLO-501/ALLO-501A target CD-19 in NHL patients, which is the same target as the approved CAR-T’s Kymriah and Yescarta in an overlapping patient population (DLBCL, a subtype of NHL), defraying clinical risk
* Allogene will be taking the dose-finding learnings from the ALPHA trial into the ALPHA2 trials for ALLO-501A, the next-generation construct and P2 candidate in NHL, a switchover that has been planned since before the ALPHA trial was initiated 
* In an earnings call on 05/06, Allogene CEO David Chang indicated that the abbreviated P1 portion of ALPHA2 is on track to begin 2Q20, ahead of a potential pivotal P2 portion
* However, the current price point is somewhat overvalued, and thus does not support us taking a larger position given the potential downside is substantial and potential gains partially already baked in

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***High unmet clinical need:*** substantial need for accessible and efficacious therapies remains in NHL &amp; other hematological malignancies given limited options for r/r patients and the time-consuming and burdensome process required for current CAR-Ts
* ***‘Off the shelf’ CAR-T therapies address shortcomings of current CAR-Ts*****:** the approach would theoretically mitigate the manufacturing issues that continue to drag down the commercial potential of and patient access to existing autologous CAR-T’s
* ***Several critical near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ASCO poster abstract covering initial P1 data for ALLO-501 in r/r NHL (ALPHA trial) will be released on 05/13, with further data including additional patients presented on 5/29. These data will support the ALPHA2 P1 and potential pivotal P2 trial for ALLO-501A, their next-generation construct for NHL. Initial P1 data for ALLO-715 in r/r MM (UNIVERSAL trial) remains on track for 4Q20 despite impact of COVID-19
* ***Experienced leadership team with track record of rapid development and regulatory success in cell therapy:*** CEO David Chang and Executive Chairman Arie Belldegrun were formerly CMO and CEO of Kite Pharma, respectively, and led Yescarta, one of two CAR-T’s on market today, to FDA priority review prior to acquisition by Gilead for $11.9 B (29.4% premium over market close prior to announcement)
* ***Clinical programs focus largely on proven targets:*** ALLO-501/ALLO-501A and UCART19 are anti-CD19 therapies, which is the same target as the approved autologous CAR-Ts Yescarta and Kymriah, which somewhat de-risks these programs. Additional targets in development include BCMA for MM (ALLO-715, including in combination with nirogacestat in collaboration with SpringWorks)
* ***Preliminary UCART19 data offers additional validation of platform:*** preliminary pooled data from P1 trials in ALL indicated that 14/17 (82%) of patients receiving an anti-CD52 antibody during lymphodepletion achieved a complete response (CR/CRi). The anti-CD52 antibody serves to protect the allogeneic CAR-T’s from being cleared by the body’s immune system. ALLO-501, ALLO-501A, and ALLO-715 are all dosed with ALLO-647, Allogene’s internally developed anti-CD52 antibody, creating a “window of persistence” during which the allogeneic CAR-T’s can exert their therapeutic effect

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Value of pipeline programs heavily interdependent:*** Given the clinical stage therapies are rooted in the same technology platform, any issues that emerge from the ALPHA or UNIVERSAL trials could feasibly drag down the value of the entire pipeline. On the flipside, however, positive preliminary ALPHA data would likely have the reverse effect of increasing PTRS across the clinical-stage portfolio
* ***Stock currently trading at / near 52 week high:*** While Allogene traded in the $18 - 20 range for the latter part of March, the price has rebounded steadily upwards and scraped against an all-time high today on just-shy of average volume, reflecting both the overall market rebound and likely enthusiasm from the market for the impending ASCO data. This suggests there is significant immediate downside if the data falls short of expectations on 5/13 and 5/29
* ***Long-term competitive risk is substantial:*** While Allogene is a leader in the field, the next-generation CAR-T space is fairly crowded. In addition, Fate Therapeutics (market cap: $2.3 B) has a pipeline of iPSC-derived natural killer and T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors reaching the clinic. While Allogene is exploring the iPSC space as mentioned above, Fate Tx has reached the clinic already, which may provide them with a leg-up in the long-run

So, I found annual percent returns on Yahoo Finance, [example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSCSX/performance?p=FSCSX), and I put the data in Excel. For fund FSCSX (provided in the link), I'm looking at the annual percent return between 1986-2019.  I just took the previous year's value and multiplied by the annual percent return for x year. Example below

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Annual % Return|Total Value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1985|\-|$10,000|
|1986|13.86%|$11,386|
|1987|9.44%|$12,460|
|1988|9.05%|$13,588|

I got confused when I calculated the average annual return and compared it to the annualized return for FSCSX. They differ by 2% and obviously if I were to find a cumulative return using the same method as above just using either of the two percentages, the final value between the two would differ.

investing,"In the equity market, fear of missing out seems to be overshadowing fear of all that’s wrong with the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&amp;P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.

Fiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.

Financial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.

“A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&amp;P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.

The index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.


Kostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&amp;P 500’s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.

“The ‘fear of missing out’ best describes the thought process,” Kostin said.

Futures positioning shows investors still doubt S&amp;P 500 rebound

But he warns that it’s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs’ sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.

“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” the strategist writes.

relates to Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO
Kostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.

Caution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021’s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.

The benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side’s estimate of next year’s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.

Until recently, many policy makers and corporate executives were hoping for a V-shaped economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic: a short, sharp collapse followed by a bounce back to pre-virus levels of activity.

Now, however, they expect a “swoosh” recovery.

Named after the Nike logo, it predicts a large drop followed by a painfully slow recovery, with many Western economies, including the U.S. and Europe, not back to 2019 levels of output until late next year—or beyond.

The sobering new view reflects the depth of the contraction now being recorded for the spring, as well as more evidence that soaring joblessness and months or years of social distancing—particularly in the West—will depress economic activity well into next year.

“This is not going to be a quick recovery,” said Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestlé SA, the world’s biggest packaged foods maker, recently. “This is going to be a several-quarter, if not several-year kind of process.”

Mr. Musk blasted the move and said over the weekend he was going to move the Palo Alto-based company’s headquarters out of state.

Today May 8 SVXY: 35.35, VIXM: 37.64

If you bought $5000 of both on the March 23rd bottom when SVXY: 30.25, VIXM: 39.74, you would have ~165.29 shares of SVXY and ~125.82 shares of VIXM which would be worth $10578.87 today.

If you bought $5000 of both on Feb 19 right before the crash when SVXY: 67.66, VIXM: 20.10, you would have ~73.89 shares of SVXY and ~248.75 shares of VIXM which would be worth $11974.96 today.

Because if the money supply increases ie inflation, people will see this, and go buy gold with the extra money...because it's an inflation hedge? Right? It only works as an inflation hedge if other people think it is an inflation hedge and treat it as such. So if we all agree it is an inflation hedge then it kind of is, but there's nothing fundamental about it that makes it an inflation hedge.

Will people just naturally regress to gold as the store of value just because that's what people did in the past? Then forget the scenario where your gold is in 1s and 0s, in the scenario where you need to spend actual gold you're not getting that metal no matter how you think you own it.

Am I missing something here? It basically feels like everyone sees gold as the global back up currency and because they're all in it together (and telling others) this keeps it working that way. There's no central bank or political authority to back this faith either like there is with USD.

The value of gold should be determined the same way as copper, demand for use in production of goods and services. It is no different than every other commodity except that because it didnt tarnish in the past and it's shiny and pretty, we for some reason treat it different.",How is investing in gold not an unintentional ponzi scheme?
investing,"Hello all,

I was wondering what people in this subreddit were thinking of ALLY financial. I am no customer (not even US based) but I have heard good things about its daily business demeanor and general customer satisfaction. This is why I started looking into it and after checking out its yearly report and latest quarterly I have started considering it.

Obviously ALLYs biggest problem is its exposure to auto loans, with sub prime loans being a major risk (although only accounting for 11% of its portfolio if I remember correctly). The way they handled this crisis by reaching out to customers to allow delayed payments, actually stopping share buybacks but still offering dividend, makes me quite confident in the companies attitude.

The biggest concerns I probably have are that their second quarter will probably also be horrible and the fact that many people have raised concerns about the companies earlier history with auto loans around 2008 where they were in quite some distress. 

Does anyone have  more insights or has been following the company? If things were getting  better quickly I think this would be quite a safe bet.

Looking forward to your answers.",Thoughts on ALLY Financial?

investing,"Hi, I'm early thirties, single, California.

\~2.38mm net worth

$200k invested in REITs

$270k invested in market ETFs

$160k in cash

$1,750,000 in diversified individual stocks

I live off income from the above, \~$44,000k / year.

I live in a car, and generally satisfied. I've been floating around for the past 4 years, traveling domestically, and a little bit abroad. The recent corona thing forced me to temporarily move back home with my mentally unstable mother. Although I'm now back on the road and things are better, my view on life has changed slightly and I feel like it may be a prudent move to have somewhere to go when I'm not out on the road. I had a rough upbringing with my mentally unstable mother and generally have a negative view of Real Estate and prefer to be ""nomadic"" or out on the road.

I've been looking at real estate lately and have mentally prepared my self to sell about 200k in either the ETFs or the REITs to increase my cash to $365k in order to buy some land. I can't stop thinking about whether this is the right move.

I'm thinking about some land in CA because it is close to my friends. All or most of the properties within this budget means that they would mostly be raw land, possibly with a well, maybe a storage structure, manufactured, some or none of these improvements. They are generally zoned rural, rural residential, or agricultural.

It's a dramatic change for me in terms of lifestyle because I would have less cash, and less dividend income. But in exchange, I would have a 10-50 acre land, with possibly some improvements.

One of the problems for me valuing the net benefit of this change, is whether A. the financials make sense, and B. if this suits my lifestyle.

I'm worried about the land being worth much less than what I paid for it in the future, and B. would I even enjoy the change in lifestyle. For example, what would I realistically be doing with the land? I don't have any great idea for its purpose other than a safe haven for me away from my mentally unstable mother and using it for gatherings, storage, and projects.

I've thought about doing creative projects such as improving the land, (treehouse, a warehouse, a tinyhome), but the thought of the permits and interaction with contractors make me anxious, since laying foundation, a prefab structure, and erection crew could cost nearly 50-100k and that would eat into my savings, and I have no experience with any of this.  Also, I think I want no more than 15% of my net worth ($350k) in Real Estate. (I would like to to stay diversified).

How risky is raw land with a few improvements in California?

If I buy raw land in CA for $350k, add $100k of improvements, is there a possibility of me going to sell 5 years down the line, and losing money/getting less than the sum of the parts (or $450k)?

Does anybody have any words of advice for me? I never thought about buying land before this Corona thing started. My plan previously was to live in the car as long as possible.",Life direction- anxiety over investing in Real Estate

investing,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/11/coronavirus-fda-grants-emergency-use-authorization-abbott-labs-antibody-test.html

&gt;The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories’ new coronavirus test that detects Covid-19 antibodies, the company announced Monday.
Abbott said it plans to ship nearly 30 million tests this month and will have the capacity to ship 60 million tests in June. 
The tests can indicate whether a person has had Covid-19 and was either asymptomatic or recovered.

&gt;“Having more options of highly reliable tests across our platforms will help healthcare workers and health officials as they conduct broad scale testing for Covid-19,” Abbott CEO Robert Ford said in a statement.
The authorization means laboratories will be allowed to use the test even though it has not been formally approved or cleared by the FDA.
U.S. officials and corporations across America are pouring money into antibody testing, hoping it will give people the confidence to return to work and reopen parts of the economy. President Donald Trump has recommended states use the tests as they start relaxing some of the strict social distancing measures imposed to combat the pandemic, which has infected more than 1.3 million people across the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. 

&gt;Last week, the FDA tightened rules for coronavirus antibody tests, ordering manufacturers to submit emergency use authorization forms within 10 days.
Since the FDA issued its initial antibody test policy in mid-March, the agency said it has become aware of “a concerning number” of commercial serology tests being promoted inappropriately, including for diagnostic use, or performing poorly.

&gt;This is Abbott’s fourth Covid-19 test to win emergency use authorization. Abbott had already launched three coronavirus tests in the United States, including a rapid test that produces results in as little as five minutes and the newly released test that shows if a person has antibodies against the virus.
The company announced last month that it was working with CVS Health to get its tests “outside of the hospital” and into places like urgent-care clinics and nursing homes.

&gt;Abbott said the new test is more efficient and can provide more tests and take up less space, an important feature the company said for labs that process tens of thousands of patient samples but are often short on space.
It can exclude false positives 99.6% of the time and exclude false negatives 100% of the time for patients tested 14 days after symptoms began, the company said Monday.
It plans to submit for European CE mark approval this week.

investing,"Institutions control the overwhelming majority of the power to sway the markets. Blue chip companies - check who hold their largest voting blocs - it’s the institutions: BlackRock, Vanguard, et al. Who controls the ETFs? The pension funds that the peasants store their measly savings in? The same old boys’ club. It is they who set the share prices, period.

Everyone talks about how it’s FOMO that’s driving prices up the wall. But because they aren’t allowed to, no one ever talks about the puppet masters behind the scenes. Yes, maybe the retail trade sector has some nominal influence to an extent but the real clout is held by the big guns. AND the exchanges that the populace punt on. That’s why, if you’ll notice, the markets move in almost perfect lockstep. They move these massive blocks at the precise time of their choosing. No one ever talks about how the institutions know exactly where the market is going at any given point in time not because they can predict the future but because they are the ones that manipulate it and set the prices.

Who came out and called the bottom after the smoke cleared and the dust settled? Larry Fink who advises Trump and heads BlackRock, a firm that has been tasked by the Fed to run several stimulus programmes, and strategists’ at Goldman Sachs, among others. Rick Rieder, also of BlackRock, sits on a committee of the New York Fed. The lion’s share of the newly printed stimulus trillions is flooding into their coffers and washing out all the bad debt. Voila, their books are squeaky clean all of a sudden. Where do they pour this fresh cash? Into the markets, inflating it and thereby locking out everyone else.

In this thinly-veiled vulgar display of crony capitalism, they have flaunted that they will never be held accountable and thus the same tired behaviour will continue ad infinitum, and the next decade/s-long bull market will no doubt be a repeat of the infantile card pyramid debt-stacking that we’ve all seen eventually fall over and over, time and time again, the mess promptly swept under the rug by Uncle Sam in a mammy apron. 

Meanwhile, stimulus for main street and the working class quickly runs out, having been reduced to sloppy seconds by the ruling class who must always have their fill first, yields of anything other than equities, and maybe gold, are negative or at best infinitesimal, market valuations are at exorbitant and hardly-justifiable all-time highs, and the commonfolk are once again caught holding the bag with a quickly-sinking economy, ever-increasing and never-before-seen levels of unemployment and rapidly-rotting debt, and of course, the piece-de-resistance, the cherry on the creampie, a horrendously-manhandled health crisis, haphazardly steered by a drunk driver who’s only destination is reelection, passengers’ destination be damned.

I've recently found myself speculating and thinking to myself, now in a post coronavirus crash world with a stock market seemingly bouncing back fairly strong, (assuming the coronavirus will be reigned in over the next month(s) and us being spared a second, and potentially third, devastating wave)

What will be the strongest growing sectors from June forward over the next half year, 1 year and 3~5 year terms?

I think the renewable energy sector will continue to grow strong, as it did the last few years, I also think that the medical supply/pharmaceutical sector has some real growth, especially the parts of the sector that can capitalize on supplying relief for coronavirus, PPE, testing kits, and the golden goose vaccine/cure.

On smaller levels (small countries and indexes) vs on the bigger international stage/US stock market I also see alot of growth for different sectors. In my own country, Sweden, I see the housing market, online gambling, cloud services and new technology as good bets.

But I'm also left wondering. Alot of sectors that dropped alot, in industry and manufacturing etc, that weren't necessarily strong bets before the crash, to what degree they'll recoup their loses, and to what degree they'll grow in this time period.

Now I know that is true, but what is omitted is the fact that Elon is a little bit of a loose cannon.

Live at home and saving, looking to move out within the next few years.

Take home $2300 every 2 weeks = ~60k a year after taxes 

I've worked at the aforementioned job for 7 months and saved 17k (I paid off 10k in loans also and now debt free)

Question:

Which would be the better option:

1) use current and future savings (within a year) to outright buy a house out of state and rent out and become a slumlord 

Or 

2) continue saving for 3 to 4 more years and afford a house to live in of my own


Essentially it comes down to: use savings to buy rental property and use rental income to supplement my own or keep saving and eventually buy place of my own locally.


3rd bonus option is to buy a local duplex/triplex and live in 1 unit and rent out the other(s) until able to move out.

investing,"Last week, we initiated a position in Springworks Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SWTX), and as promised, we’re providing our view on the company. 

**Summary:** Founded in 2017, Springworks is a $1.4B market cap biotech company developing targeted oncology therapies for rare tumor types with high unmet need. We like Springworks for several key reasons: 

* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. 
* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks’ assets and creating a future growth runway. 
* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat’s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib’s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. 
* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. 

**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. 

**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:

Nirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. 

* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. 
* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients’ quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. 
* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.

Mirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). 

* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. 
* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). 
* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca’s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. 
* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. 

**2. Promising Clinical Data.** 

Nirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing &gt;20% in size) as the primary endpoint. 

* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. 
* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. 
* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. 
* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. 

Mirdametinib.  

* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib’s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib’s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib’s efficacy:
   * Selumetinib’s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib’s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. 
   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib’s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. 
* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib’s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. 
* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. 

**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**

* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. 
* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. 

**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. 

**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:

* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).
* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline’s vaccine division. 
* Head of R&amp;D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&amp;D for over 20 years. 

**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:

* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks’ assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. 
* *Competitive risk.* Springworks’ drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. 
* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down.

More than 1,000 workers at the Tyson Foods plant in Waterloo have tested positive for the coronavirus, a county public health leader said Thursday - more than double the number Gov. Kim Reynolds had said the day before.

The 1,031 Tyson employees confirmed to have the coronavirus included workers who were tested at the plant during the shutdown as well as at private health-care providers, Black Hawk County public officials said.

Reynolds said Wednesday that 444 workers at Tyson's Waterloo plant had tested positive.

The others were Tyson pork processing plants in Columbus Junction and Perry, and an Iowa Premium beef processing plant in Tama.Joshua Pikora, disease surveillance and investigation manager in Black Hawk County, where the Waterloo plant is located, said the governor's numbers for Waterloo reflected tests conducted only at the Tyson plant, not at health facilities elsewhere.

Dividends at 4% yield and selling some shares which have appreciated are in no comparison, selling is better.

I am a 24 year old chemical engineering student and will graduate in two years. I have a job with the city of Los Angeles as an engineering intern and make a small paycheck which I use to fund my investment account. As an individual with a small portfolio of 15K I cannot buy enough shares to “sell shares when you need cash.” I understand how Warren Buffet will save money by selling shares of BKR instead of receiving a dividend from BKR. He can sell 5% of his holding and although his % ownership declines the value of his investment goes up over the years. Trust me I understand the math but Buffet owns millions of shares and my biggest position is 11 shares of Apple. For this reason I have been leaning on dividend investing. 

Please correct me if I am wrong, qualified dividend income is taxed based off your earned income, therefore the taxes on my dividends are around 12%. Since I won’t be making any serious money until two years from now doesn’t dividend investing make sense for me? The dividends are taxed such a small amount and I can use that cash to purchase more shares of growth stocks. The goal here is putting money away to purchase a rental property after graduation.

investing,"In every universe known to man, ""smart money"" wins because smart money *is **what moves** the markets*, not in words like the news or politicians, but in actual mass, worth, mathematical impact. It's a machine, sort of a hydra, so many heads they might as well be hair. I don't know who said that the kinetics of smart money are basically gravity in the universe of *valuation*. Not just stock markets, valuation entirely, because the very idea of value tends to be subjective like that. It's gravity, it's everywhere, it pulls every atom in the universe. There's no ""counter"" force, it doesn't exist. There's no ""shield"" either, it just is.

That's why you never defy smart money, if you know where it stands (that's the hard part, and no it's not a ""secret""). That would be the equivalent of jumping over a cliff to prove something (*spoile... oh come on.*). That's why contrarians still hedge, on the side of caution. That's why people still buy houses or gold or invest in education even at the worst of depressions —if they can, after they feed themselves. That's why governments know they can pile debt like there's no tomorrow because effectively, if smart money says ""there's no tomorrow"" then the sun don't shine that day and it's all there is to it. Netflix still rolls as usual (arguably more, even). That's why wages can't rise too high but bonuses will.

It's the ultimate absurdity of it all: we can say just about anything like kids do in games, and it happens. We just seldom do, not really, not like that. *End wars?* Done. *End hunger?* Done. End disease? Nope, nobody can do that, so collectively saying so doesn't matter. When can vaccinate, but then it's a conspiracy to sell Windows. This absurd insight is one of magnitude, not a generalization that mankind could do wonders by wishful thinking, make magical unicorns self-multiply every 2 hours (that's not absurd but nonsensical). 

But neither wars nor hunger will end, today or tomorrow, because we won't say so, not really, not like that. Because it's still absurd, even if it's not nonsensical, if it has meaning.

So let's revel on what we said already, what we have right now. It's already quite a lot, when you stop and ponder versus anyone just a century ago and forever before. And let's push the envelope where it matters, baby steps.

World finance is a big *non*-zero sum game, it's literally the blood of modern times, because we say so, and until we make it otherwise (for instance back to a zero-sum game, where your loss is definitely the only way to my win), and shoot everybody else in the foot and heart, like madmen. I'm all for positive pacific revolutions, whether *occupying the 1% of bitcoins in Spring for global healthcare* or whatever. But don't fight smart money. Don't think anyone can wish gravity away like it's some sort of choice, like it's anyone decision. It's not, not really, not like that. 

Lean into it. Learn to appreciate what it means to have smart money versus every single last century in history for the real masses of people (because an alternative world without smart money but without the past is unknown as of yet). You find it awful that it keeps some parts of the world in poverty, but it's so much more complex. It's by definition not a first-world problem and can't be wished away by first-world solutions. Scholars can't solve this one from the comfort of an office in Penn because they're not *over there* changing behaviors.

On the field, it's people like you and me just taking the money because they can, just because we say so. Spend a month, a year in Africa, in Asia, and not just the fancy cities. See the life of ""you's"", there, relatively. See why things are the way they are, and how they could be much worse, and how it's not all related to some wall in some street whether German or American. Removing the blood system for everyone on Earth would be a critical suicide case of ""this is why we can't have nice things"", because some would have drunk the blood when they were not supposed to (*see how all the common imagery fits nicely together? Not me, not my doing, for truth is built-in language so often...*) 

Responsibilities must be enforced however, individually as in any organization, and that is a topic for this century due to inter-dependency.

In principle, smart money is everything but ""people"": smart money never was ""someone"" or ""someone-s"". It's a collective, like the invisible hand of Adam Smith, but less magic, many more hands, and one shady legal persona nonetheless. And hands do *transfers of money*... yes, *that* drift (implicitely so, to keep it civil below). Smart money is why this world can breathe even when it physically can't, as 60% of the world's population is at home and yet the world still keeps happening to a shockingly good extent (all things considered). At any other time in history, it would not have been an option (it is still not, as we speak, in many countries, because people would simply starve in weeks), and that is a testament of some economic might, that I want to consider globally as a species (think less geopolitics and more Kardashiev/Sagan in this perspetive), whatever we politically feel about it, whatever we'd say in a debate of ""should we and how?"", this episode 2020 is definitely a major feat of the human race.

And that was in urgency. Now give it 10 years, and if we do any sort of decent preparation, in terms of infrastructure and knowledge, we could pretty much operate the world while most of us work from home, given the level of technical progress we've achieved. This was the promise of mechanization and machinery all along, right? To be able to just press a button? And wherever that button is, post-internet? (*self-censored bad javascript joke*)

But this event is also proof that some of the richest countries on Earth right now ""can't have too many nice things"" because their economy is profiled in such a way that does not allow for it, even if (some of) their life depended on it (quite literally so I'm afraid). It's a choice, at the very least, to continue in that direction, or not, and the reasons, the hierarchy of values that defines each of us individual and collectively, is much wider than this topic. But ""smart money"" **will be right about it however**, because smart money is what will make ""it"" happen, whatever it [the next new world] happens to be. You don't want to be on the wrong side of that, it's a bit of a historical fork. 

You also should know that in consumerism, voting with a wallet is what ultimately drives smart money;  
that in investing your wallet has 100× more impact on your values regarding the world and moving needles;  
and that in post-internet times your very behavior online is part of that equation as the human kind gets abstracted in big data. Whether your behavior (bots/AI of tomorrow) or your browser history (rest assured that sentiment is meaningful however, it's normal to visit things we have negative feeling about, know thy enemy and all that). The world is nothing but what we make of it, online or not.

Now to address the elephant in any room with ""smart money"".

There never was any formal conspiracy, it's all an informal convergence of interests, no more no less. (not a cataclysm yet, no joke either). Face it, Adam Smith won that battle, because the thing is now so massive and so complex that nobody has a god damn switch to really move it at will (those who do are regulated but in the grander scheme of things... nobody can give ±100% to the S&amp;P over the next 10 years, nobody has that kind of power anymore even as a collective. Kings are truly gone). The invisible hand was a self-fulfilling prophecy, is all. 

It's a form of collective agreement (true, *though distorted*) quite special to our modern era. It's sensible because it empirically prevents upheaval, promotes growth, progress and stability, *within the context of its existence* (no way to affirm this would be true in all external conditions). We learned however that it's important to promote a system that doesn't generate as much inequity, that's apparently the only real cataclysmic part everyone and their mother should be worried about (because it tends to be proven in other sciences that it decreases life expectancy globally, and a slew of other social problems do worse). 

Smart money is all these things, and more. You may have a specific definition today— I'm eager to read some in the commentary —but smart money is a more general idea that predates and outlasts most particular historical snapshots we use to describe it (cue rolling eyes on claims that ""it's all because the Fed"" or this person did this thing with gold... *it matters, a lot* in the short-term, don't miskate my words; but it matters not when you try to navigate this historical period versus *other* historical periods, not knowing what this one actually is but in hindsight, thus the ultimate significance of events).

You don't know that gold will triple in the next 8 years and 10× before 2040.   
You don't know that my predictions are as good as my love for science-fiction (definitely lacking and I blame time). Our knowledge will always be partial, so it's sane to focus on what we know. Smart money knows:

- Reforms will be needed fast before more dire circumstances remove the ""business as usual"" card from the hands of decision-makers (it will happen, whether a really bad virus, a war, natural catastrophe, terrorism.. still 80+ years to go for this century, we've not completed 20% so far). So we have 6-12 years to do the job give or take, and the best will be there by 2023. 

- UBI is basically the conclusion of the Tobin tax that never was, and seems like a decent approach to me (but muh opinion, who cares), if it can be indexed to the financials of its region (fact however, inflation is the big enemy of redistribution, more so than otherwise). I have no idea what smart money thinks, no one does remember, but it's already what European countries do in monetary mass redistributed /GDP per persona, only framed in a much more ""universal"" fin/math way indeed.

- Pushing on virtualization and ""remoting"" humans to increase worldwide collaboration is also a great avenue of improvement (for quality of life, anti-fragility of society, etc) that's been demonstrated as totally feasible within 5 years or so. Collaterally automating big logistics/production centers with non-biologicals (robots, self-sanitizing buildings, etc) is a strong path to a few decades of economic prosperity as we transform infrastructure and eliminate all menial jobs of the 20th century and transition to the next paradigm. Not what I intend to discuss here, it's another topic, but it's really just the right part of the S-curve for this domain now 80 years in the making (see, again, sci-fi for references, if Boston Dynamics isn't enough).

So, smart money. Talking to you know, whether a cog, a hair in the machine, or more figures than my hand has fingers happening to read by. Know what you built, others before you, previous versions of the machine; and know what's left to do, find the best makers of that, and invest on. 

The rest of us, the ""less smart"" I guess, it's pop-corn time for the next decade. Please mind the reapers though, they announce fortunes to be made but tend to leave a lasting mark if you touch one. Happy r/investing.

I have had this long term plan in back of my mind that someday I want to buy land in the mountains, pay it off.. then build on it and retire 

I've bought and sold two homes in my life and am now on my third, married and planning on paying this one off. - I've got roughly 160K in equity and house is valued at $340K and I am locked at 3.125 on a 15 year loan so all good there.

I'm trying to think through this next piece though, It would be really cool to start making small steps now toward owning some land someday but from what I gather, interest rates on land itself are not friendly (banks don't want to get stuck)  so I'm kind of debating two options - buy soon (next 5 years) and finance or buy later (in 10-20) and pay cash but I think life has a way of making saving that much difficult.

My other thought on the matter and I have no idea if its warranted is that a large percentage of landowners in the US are older and will need to offload it in the next 10 years - potentially causing prices to dip with increased supply- perhaps that's an over generalization but I would be curious if there was a way to find out if there was merit to that. 

I'm thinking ultimately something with a view, close to water 2-3 acres and away from it all a bit - buena vista, estes park, wyoming, utah are all options.

I have been browsing this subreddit and many others and often come across many posts or comments advising to buy bitcoin, gold, or other assets which are seen as store of value investments. While we often feel our time is unique, it is important that there is rarely a situation we come across which does not allow lessons from the past. As such, I strongly encourage you to consider the below arguments put forward by Benjamin Graham in his book The Intelligent Investor.

I strongly encourage anyone who has not read this book but wants to invest and build their own wealth to read it cover to cover.

Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges

The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against the law for American citizens since 1935–luckily for them. In the past 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced from $35 an ounce to $48 in early 1972–a rise of only 35%. But during all this time the holder of gold has received no income return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done better with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in the general price level.

The near-complete failure of hold to protect against a loss in the purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the ability of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by putting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable objects have had striking advances in market value over the years—such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of books, rare stamps, and counts, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the precarious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is hard to think of paying $67,500 for a US silver dollar dated 1804 (but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.” We acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles. Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate means, except by various types of participation’s with others and with the special hazards that attach to new flotations— not too different from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All we should say to the investor is, “be sure it is yours before you go into it.”

There are several securities registration exemptions that small corporations / start-ups can use depending on which one best fits the needs of the corporation. Using a securities registration exemption can help reduce some of the legal and accounting costs compared to a typical public offering of a security. The pros and cons of the following exemptions will be discussed in detail: Regulation A+ (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Regulation D (rules 504, 506(b), and 506(c)), Regulation Crowdfunding, and Intrastate Crowdfunding (rules 147 and 147a). The main differences between the exemptions are:

* How much companies can raise under each (offering limit)
* Regulatory oversight  

   * Filing requirements
   * Disclosure requirements
* Legal and accounting costs of the offering
* Who companies can solicit their offering to and who is eligible to invest
* Whether or not state regulatory laws are preempted
* Resale of securities

Regulation A is a securities registration exemption that has two tiers. For a 12-month period, the offering limit is $20 million or less for Tier 1 and $50 million or less for Tier 2. Offering under $20 million can elect to register the securities under either Tier. Under both Tier 1 and Tier 2, the company issuing the shares (issuer) must file an offering statement on Form 1-A with the SEC. This includes offering materials, two years of financial statements and an exit report. An issuer can only accept payment for the sale of its securities once its offering statement is qualified by the staff at the SEC. This SEC qualification requirement will still result in hefty filing and legal fees. General solicitation is permitted (you can freely advertise and talk about the advertising), and there are no restrictions on the subsequent resale of the securities offering. In addition, non-accredited investors are eligible investors.

There are relatively few differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 besides the offering limits. For Tier 1 offerings, in addition to filing Form 1-A with the SEC for review and qualification, state securities regulators will likely also review and qualify required offering materials. Companies offering securities under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on Form 1-Z on the status of the offering and are subject to state regulation known as “blue sky” laws. There are no investment limits under Tier 1. Unlike Tier 1, offerings made under Tier 2 have slightly more stringent reporting requirements including ongoing annual and semi-annual reports after the offering is closed. Tier 2 offerings are not subject “blue sky” laws because federal law preempts state securities regulation. Under Tier 2, non-accredited investors are subject to certain investment limits. Although securities exempted under Regulation A are far less complicated and costly than an initial public offering (IPO), this can be a lengthy and expensive process for start-ups. Regulation A is primarily used to help growth companies raise money from non-accredited investors in a “mini-IPO” style offering as a potential alternative to institutional capital.

Regulation D is another set of securities registration exemption governed by Rules 504 and 506. Offerings under Rule 504 are limited to 5 million or less within a 12-month period, and anyone can invest in the offering. Exemptions under Rule 506 have no offering limits and is also preempts state securities law. Rule 506(c) only allows accredited investors, and Rule 506(b) allows for a maximum of 35 sophisticated non-accredited investors. For Regulation D exemptions, issuers must file Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering, and the resale of the securities is restricted. Under 506(b), additional information is required for sales to non-accredited investors. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D exemptions do not have to wait for qualification to accept payment. The main difference between Regulation D exemptions is that general solicitation (advertising) is allowed under Rule 506(c), only in limited circumstances under Rule 504, and not permitted under Rule 506(b). Start-ups generally prefer Regulation D for its relatively lower cost and fast turnaround.

Regulation Crowdfunding is another securities registration exemption that allows companies to raise up to $1.07 million from both accredited and non-accredited investors within a 12-month period. General solicitation of the offering is permitted with some limitations after Form C (similar to Form 1-A) has been filed which includes two years of certified financial statements. Unlike other exemptions, Regulation CF offerings must be offered solely through an online platform operated by an intermediary registered as either a broker-dealer or a registered funding portal. Regulation CF preempts state law, and the securities sold in the offering are subject to certain transfer restrictions for 12 months. Typically, Regulation CF is geared towards startups who plan to raise money entirely through the internet.

Intrastate Crowdfunding is another set of securities registration exemptions governed by Rules 147 and 147a. Intrastate CF offerings have no offering limit, but the issuer must be an in-state resident and “doing business” in-state. Only in-state residents can invest in an Intrastate CF offering. Intrastate CF offerings have no SEC filing requirements but are subject to state securities registration laws. Securities sold through Intrastate CF offerings can only be resold in-state for a 6-month period. The only difference between Rule 147 and 147a is that under 147a, issuers are allowed to be organized in a different state and are allowed to solicit offerees outside of the state. Intrastate CF is primarily for companies that operate in-state and plan for a community-based offering instead of a broad-based internet offering.

For small corporations, Regulation D Rule 506(c) seems like the best option to fulfill the companies initial goals. This recommendation is based on the following assumptions: 1. The goal is to raise $5-20 million in the initial round, 2. corporations would like to advertise on the internet including social media, 3. corporations is looking to keep the cost of the offering as low as possible, and 4. corporations wants to operate in all 50 states. Here, Regulation CF is not viable options because the offering limit is too low for corporations’s fundraising goals. Also, Regulation CF is less preferable because it requires a registered intermediary to conduct the offering. In addition, based on the last assumption, Intrastate CF is not a viable option because the company’s operations and investors are limited to one state. This leaves Regulation A and Regulation D as the remaining viable options.

Regulation D is preferable to Regulation A for several reasons. First, Regulation D is more cost-effective versus Regulation A because the offering documents do not have to be reviewed or qualified by the SEC. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D only requires the issuer to file Form D within 15 days after the sale of the security and the filing does not have to be qualified by the SEC. Furthermore, unlike Regulation A, Regulation D offerings under Rule 506 have no offering limit. As stated before, Regulation A is more geared towards growth companies while Regulation D is a better fit for start-ups. In this instance, the only benefits Regulation A has over Regulation D is that the offering is not limited to only accredited investors, and the resale of the securities is not limited.

Having narrowed down the exemptions to Regulation D, Rule 506(c) is the most preferable exemption in this situation. Unlike Rules 504 and 506(b), Rule 506(c) allows start-ups to advertise the offering without violating the exemption. Although Rule 504 does not limit the type of investors, there is an offering limit of $5 million, and state securities regulation is not preempted. Overall, Rule 506(c) is the most cost-effective exemption that allows start-ups to advertise its offering and reach its fundraising goals. The main limitations of Rule 506(c) offerings are that the investors must be accredited, and the resale of the security is restricted.

investing,"**Context:**

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater and quite a big name in the investment community, is currently writing a new book. In this book, he describes the rise and fall of empires and tries to model archetypical sequences of such events.

He is currently releasing chapters for free outlining the study and giving an introduction to the topic and some context to the important concepts he will later use. ([Link to articles](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/))

In the latest article, he is explaining the debt cycles and how they work.   


Short-term deb cycle: smaller economic expansions and contractions which typically last around 8 years.

Long-term debt cycle: big economic contractions and debt-restructuring like the great depression.

Video made by him explaining this much more eloquently than I ever could: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

**Main point:**

Reading through the article I stumbled upon this gem about when the long-term debt cycle is ending:

&gt;More specifically, the ability of central banks to be stimulative ends when the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit growth that pass through the economic system to produce real economic growth.  

This is very much in line with what we are seeing right now. Asset prices go up but the economy is not really ""stimulated"".

And what that means is retailers with weak balance sheets or weak business models are either going to file for bankruptcy and liquidate or ultimately restructure their balance sheets and sort of emerge in a more sustainable fashion. And weak retail real estate or poorly located or low-quality retail real estate that might have been able to hang around for a longer period of time will quickly see its values diminish and possibly something different happening with it, meaning a lot of the repurposing, one of the big hold ups to some of this lower quality retail real estate being repurposed into something else, was that it’s still had a higher and better use as sort of low-quality retail real estate.""

investing,"I've seen a lot of posts about how the market is too high and it doesn't make sense.  Here are some perspectives for why things are bad and should be down from January, but also why things aren't so bad that we should be at 2008 levels.

1.  About 75% of new unemployment is expected to be temporary.  This puts true unemployment levels at numbers that are obviously bad, but not 2008 level bad.
2.  Interest rates are at all time lows.  If you've taken a corporate finance class this would help explain the risk premium.  Assume most people see stocks as requiring an additional 5% return above the risk free rate.  If the risk free rate drops from 3% to 1%, your expected return from stocks drops from 8% to 6%.  When this happens, the price of stocks go up and not down.  To explain this, assume we have a company that only pays out 100% of profits as dividends.  Under the old normal, you'd pay $100 for a stock and expect $8 in dividends every year (an 8% return).  Now the question is, how much would you pay for the same stock if it earns -$8 this year and $8 per year after that, but you now demand only a 6% return.  The formula becomes $8 in perpetuity minus the immediate change for this year of $16 or $8/.06 - $16 = $117.33.  Obviously, these are made up numbers to illustrate a point.  That point is, prices go up when interest rates go down.  If you want to make the formula more complex, assume low interest rates for 5 years then back to the higher level after that, which may be more representative of the current environment.
3.  The Fed is backstopping everything.  What this essentially means is that the money printing machine in America is issuing loans.  If these loans are paid back, then the Fed will earn money on its investment and we will have deflation.  However, the Fed can simply print more money to help avoid deflation.  The other side of this equation, would be that the Fed invests poorly and loses money.  Now, we instead have inflation which the Fed can then stop printing money to a certain extent.  Assuming they lose grip and inflation becomes quite high, this is also good for most stocks, especially in a nominal sense.  Stocks are generally a decent inflation hedge, not the best, but decent.
4.  Government debt is also hitting new highs.  However, we are literally issuing debt at a rate lower than our targeted inflation number.  Of course the government could spend it in ways that do not contribute to the economy at all.  However, they need to do the bare minimum to provide out performance relative to the rates they will borrow at.
5.  Due to the combination of 3 and 4 above, it is unlikely there will be a massive liquidity issue.  These are where the market crashes really come into play.  If there is no one to provide money to people, then investors start demanding very high risk premiums because money becomes very high demand.  This would influence number 2 in the opposite direction and make stocks go down.  All in all, I believe a liquidity scenario is possible but very unlikely, which is why I advocate for at least putting a majority of your cash in the market instead of waiting for a pullback.  However, hold a little cash in case there is a larger market issue.
6.  Larger businesses represent a majority of the publicly traded companies.  However, small businesses are hurt the most from the current crisis.  This one makes me very sad, but it is one of the reasons things don't look as bad in stocks.",A case for the market being appropriately valued

So he's an old man that didn't  fully understand that italian bonds have been en route to be a worthless  security for decades (he doesn't even own a computer, he basically  still lives in the '90s), because debt will just keep rising and  population will keep aging and the government will not invest in growth  but spend in useless stimulus.  


He owns a small house and  two/three years ago he put all he had in the bank in questionable Amundi  funds that italian banks offer, made of european states bonds, european  corporate bonds, european stocks ... you get the point, pretty dumb ...  large proportion of this was in italian government bonds, traditionally  banks tend to sell that crap to unsuspecting old pensioners because  let's face it, nobody that is financially literate or even remotely  sentient would buy that italian stuff as an investment ... his exposure  to italian bonds was around 25-30% of the total portfolio.  


I also  want to point out that even if he's very old he is long term oriented,  because this portfolio is already destined to his two sons in his mind,  he likes living a very frugal life on his pension and he rarely touches  anything that he has in the bank. Very saving-savy. But even if long  term is the goal, I wouldn't like to allocate too much of his belongings  into volatile stuff, simply because the money isn't mine.  


So 3  years roll around and we get the 2018-2019 bond crisis caused by the  government, and 2020 coronavirus. Ratings go down, yields go up and just  in the initial 3 months of 2020 he loses a cool 10%, primarily from  italian government bonds and european corporate bonds. Fortunately  during April a good 30% of the losses were recovered.  


I'm just so  much in conflict on where should I move his exposure tbh. Obviously  holding corporate and italian bonds is pretty dangerous (remeber that in  the next few year Italy may end up like Greece), but they could  eventually recover. But they could not. But even if I move it elsewhere,  what difference does it make? It seems like everything is so overvalued  these days.  


Gold is at an all time high accounting for  inflation, american stocks are on a fomo rally that could well collapse  in a month or two, commodities right now are a joke, other european  government bonds are also exposed to to Italy, and american goverment  bonds are at an all time high.  


I can't see a way out of this  execept putting it on the safest assets, but it still might be a loss,  and I could be wrong because maybe Italy will take a few years to get to  the Greece situation, and by that time maybe this stuff will have  recovered most of the losses

investing,"Yesterday I  listened to this very interesting podcast ( We Study Billionaires - TIP295: Mohnish Pabrai on Value Investing &amp; Philanthropy) where Mohnish Pabrai mentions what he calls secret compounders. The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company.

1. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability.
2. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company.
3. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines.
4. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this.
5. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example).

These are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion.

What criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why?

To me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion.

Here I am updating my first ever post on reddit which is the story on reacting to the market based on emotions despite all parameters aligned in my favour indicating a profitable trade turned disastrous and cost me 20% of my capital in one single session of trading.

I have explored in detail the emotional aspects of the trading when you are not able to capitalise on the trade you have done and then start taking emotional decisions to set off your loss:

1. Revenge Trading
2. Lack of Money management

Thank you for your attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market
* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a platitude of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment.  The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

&amp;#x200B;

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

China trade war. If Trump cancels the agreement we are going to see a reaction for sure in the market, the only question remaining is how bad?  

&amp;#x200B;

**3. How to not make a buying decision**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.

Do not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.

Do your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**



Ah.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.

I want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller.  Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.

Sweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.

The death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.

The majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted. 

Do not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.

I currently have a taxable account for mostly options trading and an emergency fund built up.  This emergency fund is bigger than what is typically recommended (\~8 months living expenses).  I think I'm ready to open and begin funding a Roth IRA.

What did I do wrong that all these people seem to be doing? Are they using some sort of intraday data that allows them to calculate the increase from open? Does yahoo data simply bleed into afterhours data?

But I think what we're actually witnessing here is some of technology's limitations. A zoom happy hour does not replace a real happy hour. Going to an office has real benefits. Video conferencing kinda sucks for a lot of things. Online classes aren't as engaging as in person classes. I could go on and on.

As humans, we crave real connection, touch, excitement, adventure. That doesn't stop because a virus happened in the past (when it becomes in the past). I think the travel industry will grow enormously by 2023-2025. People, by and large, aren't going to be afraid to get on an airplane. Business won't be conducted entirely online. 

I just don't see how this virus changes some of the most fundamental things about us. Will people be cleaner in public places? Sure. Will some people wear masks? Sure.

investing,"To fill the hole in GDP caused by corona, the Fed and Treasury pumped in several trillion more than the estimated fall in GDP. Of these trillions, about 2.5 trillion at most was income given to businesses and individual by Treasury. This is more than 10% of annual GDP should more than fill the hole in GDP by most estimates. The rest was in the form of Fed printing and unforgivable loans. This was to offset the capital flight to safe havens like cash and treasuries and restore liquidity to bond markets. Inadvertently, a portion of this government provided income and Fed printing ended up in stocks. Consensus says that since the amount pumped in as income and loans is greater than the fall in GDP and capital flight to safe havens, the recession is cancelled or there's a Fed put on stocks not specifically doomed or even helped by corona (FAANG, etc).

Note that while stocks have rallied, short term t-bill yields are still falling and long term treasury yields are flat after falling a lot, despite record borrowing by Treasury. Gold is flat since stocks bottomed on March 23rd. Fed futures are expecting negative interest rates. Investment grade bond yields are much lower. All of this means that smart investors expect deflation, not inflation, for several years. This is while the Fed funds rate is already at zero.

Deflation is bad for stocks, good for bonds. It doesn't matter if you own the stock of a perfect monopoly with zero debt. If your money can earn a return as cold hard cash, why would you buy stock of a business that will have lower earnings due to deflation? Yes monopolies have pricing power, but this will diminish if there's deflation and could cause a revenue/income drop. Also, deflation increases the real yield on treasuries/bonds, so stocks make less sense as an investment. So why are stocks not pricing in deflation when every other investment asset is?

Stock investors are stupider and more impulsive than bond investors. This has never been more true than in the current age of instant gratification (social media), investment gamification (Robinhood), index investing (blind and constant buying), and an 11 year, 500% stock rally that gave investors confidence in stocks and a FOMO. The trillion dollar question is, how long can all this keep stocks diverging from reality. I think over the next month, as Fed printing slows, government income tapers, and people go back to work, we'll see the top.

investing,"I  was strongly opposed to margin investing, then realized two things: 1. I’m already using leverage to make investments by not paying off my mortgage. 2. The game at this point is pretty clearly slanted to make leveraged plays pay off. If you can’t beat them join them?

That being said I want to go about it with caution. I have a pretty high risk tolerance (everyone says that in a bull market. These last few months convinced me I actually do). I’m currently 70% growth mutual funds, 20% individual stock and 10% LEAP options. 

I don’t mind seeing some temporary red, but I do want to avoid being forced to sell as massive losses by a margin call or losing my house.

Generally, is it preferred using a brokers margin or going with a HELOC? I was thinking about investing via broker margin, and opening but not initially using the HELOC. In the event of a margin call I could tap the HELOC for funds if I don’t want to be forced to sell at a bad price. Is there a better game plan there?

I was also thinking about doing it via a 24/5 broker, and picking a big ETF like SPY or QQQ. I’d then set a 10% (or maybe even 5. Depends on how much money I end up borrowing) trailing stop loss to avoid a sudden plunge. I suppose I could get screwed by a weekend drop, but that seems fairly minimal.

The one other scenario I was considering it would be to finance collateral for the short put on long synthetic leap calls. 

In the event of having to tap my HELOC I’m confident the payments wouldn’t be a problem. I’m in a well paid and stable job, and have clients from my freelance days I could pick up work for if push came to shove.

investing,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. The Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailout Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

I put $1,250 into I-Bonds on March 24th. However, I haven't seen any interest added to my current securities total yet. When I was doing a bit of research on this, the TreasuryDirect website says ""An I bond earns interest monthly from the first day of the month in the issue date. The interest accrues (is added to the bond) until the bond reaches 30 years or you cash the bond, whichever comes first.""

This makes me think that interest should be added every month on the first day of the month, but no interest has been added yet. Is something wrong, or is interest actually added to the bond every 6 months?

investing,"I understand this could be stupid, but I'm trying to understand why people place value on stocks. i.e. why do stock prices go up and people are willing to buy them? Because I don't see any actual value in owning the stock of a company unless someone is willing to pay more than what I bought it for. It kind of seems just like a massive system invented for people to take make more money.

The only reason I can think of is if a company was paying dividends of its profits earned; is there any other way a stock has tangible value?",Maybe a stupid question but:

I'm trying to figure out what Options are actually for so I came to realize that a situation I am in might be the purpose behind why Options exist.

So I have money in sort of like a bond that will mature in a couple months and I want to buy a particular stock I think has a good chance of increasing during that time. Is the purpose of buying an option as intended such that I can pay a little bit of money now to buy a Call such that I can buy the stock at a later date closer to its current price rather than the higher price later on.

For instance I would make the expiry after the bond thing matures and I would put the strike price such that the strike price + the fees and cost of the option are lower than what I can expect the stock to be trading at in a couple months.

This seems like the sort of thing Options are intended to be for, but when it is explained it is usually explained in the context of speculating, never when the money you would use to buy is non-liquid. In this situation the Option is a hedge against the increasing value of the stock while the money you would use to buy it is locked away.

The other situation I think Options are working as intended rather than as mere tools of speculation is when companies give stock options to their employees that are discounted as a form of compensation. The reason the Option gives a price that is different than the actual price in this situation is intended precisely because it is meant to encourage the employee to spend some of their money to get a stock which is worth more than they spent and the difference is compensation for them working such that the instant gain they get upon buying the discounted stock is a bit like a paid salary in that they could sell it immediately after buying it for market value.

If we go into more speculation territory buying an option sort of allows you to ""own"" various stocks at various prices without actually spending the money on them such that you could actually own another stock with that money at the same time. If something happens during that time that makes it a good buy for the strike price you could sell the stock you actually own, use the option, and then if you want you could immediately sell the option bought stock at the market value and re-buy the stock you were holding originally, perhaps even buying more of it with the profit you made with the quick sell-hold-stock, buy-call-stock-at-strike-price, sell-call-stock-for-market-value, buy-original-hold-stock. You could even layer this with many more Options than just one such that you could simultaneously ""own"" all the stocks with the same money with the risk being that your call expires before you have a good time to use it. This gives a lot more diversity than an otherwise small amount of money could provide, not to mention that the only risk you take if the price of these stocks drops is you are out the price of the Option rather than the price of the stock, the issue is you have to keep track of all that information, but if an algorithm did this ... well let's just say I now understand that guy who wanted me to make an options trading algorithm back in university that I turned down doing because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.",Is this the sort of situation Options are for?
investing,Since I just finished my semester today what are some must read investing book in your opinion,Books
investing,"OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

Retirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.

So, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).

Oh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.

If the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.

Further to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.

This is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good. The stock market is trying to say that, because of reduced competition, prices will soar, and as a result, the middle class craters into abject poverty and the world becomes less and less sustainable and stable and societal collapse is the only logical conclusion.",The problems with tech stocks

* Biocept is a company that focuses on developing innovative diagnostic solutions that give doctors &amp; their patients the necessary information all from a non-intrusive biopsy they call [Liquid Biopsy](https://biocept.com/about/)

**What are the benefits of Liquid Biopsy?**
* With their patented technology they call Liquid Biopsy, it allows for Doctors to analyze and interrogate CTCs and ctDNA for certain biomarkers.
* With this, physicians can be better informed about the actionable molecular information associated with a patient’s cancer.
* Because they use a simple blood sample, this molecular information can be obtained non-invasively and more rapidly than a tissue biopsy, this leading to a quicker/more efficient diagnosis, which allows for the doctor to curate the best treatment plan possible for the cancer patient.

**[Their tech is patent protected](https://biocept.com/patents/)**
* As of January 2018, Biocept’s liquid biopsy technologies are protected by 22 issued patents in the US, EU, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, as well as other countries.
* They have a worldwide patent protection on their highly sensitive methods for detecting cancer biomarkers in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and on circulating tumor cells (CTCs).
* They have [39 parents](https://pasteboard.co/J7tcCpl.png) around the world to protect their proprietary technology 

**Why their patent protected tech is One Of A Kind**
* Biocept has [implemented use of cocktails of antibodies](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9834817B2/en) for the capture and enrichment of cells of interest. This differentiates Biocept from similar companies and allows Biocept to capture a broader array of CTCs.
* Their [patented Target-Selector Assays for ctDNA](https://www.genomeweb.com/resources/new-product/biocept-target-selector-kits) use real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing (NGS).

At the end of the day, like I mentioned in all my other DDs, this is just all the information I dug to find with legitimate &amp; cited sources. I do this so you can make the best possible well informed decision before you decide to make a purchase. 

As I've mentioned to most of you, I'm well into the cancer companies/industry because of my father's illness. This ""Liquid Biopsy"" is seriously amazing and as soon as it catches on it will tap into a market that other companies aren't in.

Like I mentioned in this post, with traditional biopsies, it is invasive &amp; depending on the location of the tumor, some patients can't even get a biopsy. Plus with a traditional biopsy, you run the risk of aggravating the cancer &amp; accelerating it's growth. With the liquid biopsy, it changes all that and it allows for the oncologist to plan the best form of treatment since they'll have all the knowledge possible of the cancer prior to making the treatment plan.

Anyways, hope this DD can provide you the best knowledge possible so you can make a well informed decision before deciding to purchase stocks. I have tomorrow and Sunday off of work, so I will be posting more DDs on companies I feel will have positive growth this year.

investing,"Looking at Blackrocks almost 100 billion dollar valuation is far from the depth their company has in the financial world. They can manage to control around 7 **trillion** worth of assets as well as almost 3 times that amount worth of insight through their enterprise software. Blackrock Solutions has insight on the very data it can invest in. Is this not some sort of breach?

This question has been bugging me for years now and I do understand the reason they can be auditors, advisors, and investors all at once. Financial markets are extremely complex and Blackrock has the resources and abilities to tackle financial issues governments and companies have. I understand why they are chosen to fix those issues. But how are they allowed to act in all those roles that overlap?

I do understand the heads of Blackrock are also the founders and they genuinely seem to have a positive interest in society as they are willing to shift and adapt their investment and other business to a more progressive time - think how Dicks and other stores stopped selling guns. This was due to Blackrocks ability to shift market sentiment based on their philosophies. No issues with their philosophies (above was only one example) - but what happens when Blackrock finds itself under new ownership with different views? Would this not completely shift the paradigm of the current financial world?

&amp;#x200B;

This is not to say they are untrustworthy, misguided, or are unable to pick successors. It just feels astonishing to see a company with such a far reach, especially in comparison to Vanguard, Schwab, State Street, or whoever.

Today May 8 SVXY: 34.21, VIXM: 38.78

If you bought $5000 of both on Monday May 4 when SVXY: 31.93, VIXM: 41.68, you would have ~156.59 shares of SVXY and ~119.96 shares of VIXM which would be worth $10008.99 today.

If you bought $5000 of both on the March 23rd bottom when SVXY: 30.25, VIXM: 39.74, you would have ~165.29 shares of SVXY and ~125.82 shares of VIXM which would be worth $10533.87 today.

If you bought $5000 of both on Feb 19 right before the crash when SVXY: 67.66, VIXM: 20.10, you would have ~73.89 shares of SVXY and ~248.75 shares of VIXM which would be worth $12174.30 today.

As payments continue to pile up and they still remain unemployed, they will remove more until all of the effects snowball and we crash again.

investing,"* In the U.S., at least, a huge percentage of corporate earnings come from tech companies that generate huge profits from relatively few employees
* As an example of the above, consider Facebook, which earned $18 billion last year with 44,000 employees, and contrast it with GM, which earned about $6 billion with 164,000 employees
* This makes employment less relevant to corporate earnings than it was in the past (not to say there's not still a correlation)
* Not only that, but these tech companies have more flexibility to offer Work-From-Home arrangements than other companies do
* So their productivity needn't take a hit during this particular recession; advertising revenue will decline but not to a crippling degree
* Additionally, a good few of these tech companies have almost no debt. No debt means no interest expense, which makes it easier to turn profits even with revenue down.
* Some recent earnings reports bear this out, such as Facebook's 100% year-over-year growth in EPS, Amazon's 26% revenue growth, etc.
* Conclusion: publicly traded U.S. stocks as a class, particularly NASDAQ-listed ones, aren't necessarily getting hit that hard when you consider what a large percentage of their composition by market cap is tech stocks.

&gt; (Bloomberg) — Syed Shah usually buys and sells stocks and currencies through his Interactive Brokers account, but he couldn’t resist trying his hand at some oil trading on April 20, the day prices plunged below zero for the first time ever. The day trader, working from his house in a Toronto suburb, figured he couldn’t lose as he spent $2,400 snapping up crude at $3.30 a barrel, and then 50 cents. Then came what looked like the deal of a lifetime: buying 212 futures contracts on West Texas Intermediate for an astonishing penny each.


&gt; What he didn’t know was oil’s first trip into negative pricing had broken Interactive Brokers Group Inc. Its software couldn’t cope with that pesky minus sign, even though it was always technically possible — though this was an outlandish idea before the pandemic — for the crude market to go upside down. Crude was actually around negative $3.70 a barrel when Shah’s screen had it at 1 cent. Interactive Brokers never displayed a subzero price to him as oil kept diving to end the day at minus $37.63 a barrel.

investing,"So we know that the American response to COVID-19 has been bad. Historically, cometing for the fucking Darwin awards bad. Here are the differences between the USA and (most) other first world countries

1. Lack national contact tracing program
2. Insufficient testing - especially for the case loads expected and in rural communities
3. Insufficient PPE for hospitals and essential workers
4. Lack of national quarantine plan
5. A desire by a minority (\~5-10% of the population) to ignore most safety recommendations - and no repercussions if safety recommendations are ignored
6. Reopening Super-spreader locations (Churches, factories, and Saloons)
7. A refusal by top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate a international response
8. A refusal of top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate a national response
9. Growing partisanship about the response creating a lack of a response (mostly noticeable in mask wearing)

So, what does this mean? The US will ""flatten"" the curve, but not eradicate the virus. In other words, the virus will continue to spread for the next 3-6 months in an uncontrolled fashion (with an R0 value very close to 1 meaning daily new cases/death counts remain mostly the same). That doesn't necessarily mean there will be another spike in infections (although that is entirely possible).

This is based mostly that cases are rising outside of NY. That has been happening with the strictest quarantines in place, which are now being loosened.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html)

This also takes into account the testing rate, since new deaths are dropping in NY, yet the rest of the countries total deaths remains nearly constant.

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) (scroll down to reported deaths).

There are a lot of big economies (France, Germany, China, Japan, South Korea, Italy, Australia, Switzerland, Spain, Netherlands, and Turkey) that have reduced the number of infections to controllable levels. That means if they determine an infected person, they can perform contact tracing on that infection and reduce the number of new infections by a significant amount (I'm guessing reducing the likelihood of another infection by 75% - bringing the R0 value down significantly below 1).

These countries are going to be looking to fully re-open their economies (football games, bars, casinos, etc). They'll be stuck between two options. Keep their economy open to the US and risk a new outbreak (and thus the economic hit) or close their economy to the US and take the economic hit until the US gets the virus under control. Essentially, a travel ban of people traveling from the US (and other countries that don't have the virus under control). Since the Trump administration is inept on the international stage, he won't have much leverage to convince these countries otherwise. 

Another affect of this, if the US has an uncontrolled spread of the virus means that factories will be shut down at random (as an outbreak occurs in a factory) in the US for a period of 3-6 months where other countries are humming along. That means that buyers of products will look for alternative supplies outside of US companies. This means that big businesses such as GM, BA, F, GE, etc lose long-term market share to competitors in other countries. This can hit other places such as entertainment where no new US movies are produced, and no US sports are produced. This creates a vacuum in the marketplace for other competitors.

investing,"[Average Year](https://imgur.com/PxMmxap.png)

The above picture is the graph of what the average year looks like for the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the span of Jan 1971 - Present. [It was inspired by this (now removed) post from yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gfg0g2/what_does_the_average_year_of_the_stock_market/)

**How did I produce this?**

I used the daily closing values for the Dow listed on [this website](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/DJIA/historical-prices). This was the most thorough stock market history I could find on short notice. Let me know if there is a better data set I can use!

I wrote a quick and dirty Python script to calculate the percentage change over every day ranging from 1971 until now and take the geometric mean of those changes for each day of the year, ranging from Jan 1 to Dec 31.

I then put all of those cumulatively together to graph the above.

**What about weekends and holidays?**

The trickiest part conceptually may have been how to interpolate the data to account for weekends and other market closures, since those do not come on regular dates. Since I was using closing values, what I ended up doing for a typical weekend was just geometrically averaging the change from Friday close to Monday close over Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

---

For example, let's say we have the following closing values:

Thurs: 9000
Fri: 9100
Mon: 9300

Then I would calculate the change for Friday to be: 9100/9000 = 1.01111
And I would calculate the change for Sat, Sun, and Mon to be (9300/9100)^1/3 = 1.00727

So the list of changes would look like:

Fri: 1.01111

Sat: 1.00727

Sun: 1.00727

Mon: 1.00727

---

It's not ideal, and can probably cause some artifacts, but it shouldn't matter too much when averaging over a lot of dates.

**Other Graphs:**

I also constructed similar graphs using [arithmetic mean of daily changes](https://imgur.com/5mJovZ2.png) and the [median of daily changes](https://imgur.com/HWJtAjT.png).

The arithmetic mean graph is very similar to the geometric mean graph, but is a bit more extreme. This isn't too surprising.

The median graph is much more balanced, which also makes sense. It seems that the most dramatic effects of the first graph are caused by a relatively small number of extreme years.

It would also be really easy to adapt my code to work with a different time span or index. I would just need the data. It might be interesting to compare the average annual performance of different sectors or market caps.","Using data going back to 1971, I graphed the the ""average year"" for the stock market."

investing,"By Natalie Wong

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s shutdown is pressuring loans
tied to commercial real estate, with retail and hotels hit the
hardest.
April payments were late on about $7 billion of commercial
mortgage-backed securities debt backed by properties in the
city, more than double the amount a year earlier, according to
data firm Trepp.
About $740 million of those loans are considered
delinquent, meaning at least 30 days behind. Retail and lodging
debt, the sectors with the highest percentage of delinquencies,
accounted for 41% and 19% of the total.
Stay-at-home orders have crushed business at stores,
restaurants and hotels in New York, the center of the
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Owners of these properties --
including hotels in Times Square and shops on Fifth Avenue --
are struggling to pay mortgages as their rent collections fall.
The rate of delinquencies could grow if borrowers continue
to skip payments in May, which is likely given the shutdown’s
impact on the economy.
Some landlords are working out payment arrangements with
their lenders, but options are limited. Special servicers, firms
assigned to handle vulnerable CMBS loans on behalf of
bondholders, are too short-staffed to manage the sudden surge of
defaults and modification requests, said Justin Piasecki, a
principal at brokerage Avison Young.

Kinda have a theory and I want to tap your thoughts. With the number of people unemployed many are currently collecting unemployment benefits. of course out of the 30 million unemployed maybe half or three quarters actually have a retirement savings plan and or health savings account. Once that runs out, people are going to start tapping into their IRA/s 401ks and other retirement savings to live on pay bills, rent, mortgage, and make ends meet. Once people start accessing their retirement savings in numbers, many funds will have to liquidate their holdings. Fund will have not choice but to liquidate parts of their holdings.

In context: 
So many companies are undervalued but personally  for me it’s impossible to buy a 100 shares of them outright right now. Instead buying a leap a 1 year out would give me enough time to save up for them and also have the company grow back in value. For ex:
A big bank like Bank of America is trading at around 23$, a hundred shares of which would cost me 2300$.  Why not just buy the atm 25$ call for 2.27 and break even of 27.27$ per share(expiring Jan 2021)?

investing,"I have seen so many posts calling the market greedy, in denial, irrational, etc. Listen, the stock market IS NOT the economy. The stock market is a place for people to earn money outside of the economy. When there is no better place to put the money (cash depreciates, bonds are awful, real estate has exposure) it stays in the market. And when investors see that the Fed is willing to print an unlimited amount of money no matter what the economy does, and the bottom of the great depression came essentially when the money printer was turned on, charts will indicate that stocks will continue upwards. Add to that a market made of index funds with buy and hold strategy and large cap companies insulated from physical limitations, and you'll see a short to mid term market increase despite the overall economy being in trouble. Eventually many stocks will underperform and index funds will no longer be the passive investor's golden goose, but you'll still see growth in solid companies.

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■","A dangerous gap: The market v the real economy — The Economist, May 7 2020 edn."

investing,"Many people seem perplexed about this fact. Bad news should mean that the market should go down. Problem is, bad news means more action from the state/fed. One action is as we all know 0% interest rates. What return do you need to make a profit with 0% interest rates? Anything above 0.

This means that if you can borrow money at 0% and expect a return of 0,000001% you are making a profit. The Fed saying that they will do everything to get full emplyment back means that some investors see the doom and gloom headlines as a confirmation that the Fed will keep rates low. This signals that it's worth borrowing money to put into the market, because any return above 0 is worth it. 

The only question is how long this will last. My guess is when positive news starts taking the overhand, investors will scale back their risk. Simply because the 0% interest rate and state action is less likely to last as long the more positive the sentiment gets on the economy. Sentiment will be more positive in the news and stocks will be going down. People will say that it's rigged - but it's not. It's just how the markets work, even if you hate it.

At least this is how I interpret the current situation and I am short on the market. Unless Fed and State turns positive in their sentiment, my investment is pretty much screwed. But I'm aware of this and I could of course be wrong.

But the reversal is self-reinforcing. As wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, which hurts spending and lowers investment rates while also making it less appealing to borrow to buy financial assets. This in turn worsens the fundamentals of the asset (e.g., the weaker economic activity leads corporate earnings to chronically disappoint), leading people to sell and driving down prices further. This has an accelerating downward impact on asset prices, income, and wealth.""

investing,"I like the idea of dividend investing but I feel there are many arguments on BOTH sides. I'd like to present a few and discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Dividend stocks aren't good because they just remove from the stock price.** 

So that's true. I don't think dividend stocks are good for growth. I think it is a great capital preservation if the company is solid like $T. They are the same price as they were four years ago and it is an excellent way to accumulate shares. 

**My question:** Is this more of a wealth preservation option? What about growth dividends? I'd say AAPL and SBUX are examples of this (although I think AAPL is starting to mature as a company, but that is a different problem set on its own).

**2) If they don't grow, why bother?**

I'm not sure what to say about this. Hence the reach out for opinions. I feel that while they don't excel as much as growth stocks, they do grow faster than bonds. A safe bet, IMO. Of course, assuming it is a diversified spread like SPHD which I own a small portion of.

**My question:** Can someone give opinions of good growth dividend stocks that I have not mentioned already? Secondly, can someone help me rationalize point two, where it gives a purpose for dividend investing? 

**3) DRIP or no?**

I have a question on this  one. Why not DRIP? If not drip, I guess you can  use the dividend to invest in something else. However, I want to drip so that my dividend stocks accumulate faster. Catch22?

**My question:** I only gave an example of why DRIP is good or not good. Can someone give an argument for both sides?

**4) When to buy?**

I think it is best to buy dividend stocks during a recession. I say this for three good reasons. The first reason is to **accumulate as many shares as possible.** You can not only buy cheap shares at times of recession, you also accumulate shares with dividends. It is a win win if you ask me. My next reason is that I don't really have to worry about selling out. Finally, with dividends, I do have a **cash flow coming in** if I needed it (hopefully not relying on dividend income though lmao). Getting a few low thousand a months through dividends is not that far off or unattainable IMO?

With a grain of salt though, because companies cancel their dividend like Disney and Ford. Fair enough, but that's why I try to mitigate that risk by avoiding individual companies or selecting individual companies with historical dividends (Look up dividend aristocrats). Companies like KO etc. Of course if KO stops giving dividends, then we are in bigger trouble than we realize and cash would be a better alternative.

**My question:** I say the best time is to buy Dividend stocks during recessions. Why? Best way to accumulate shares. Can someone puncture my argument? Secondly, What dividend strategy do you use (loaded question, would appreciate it though)?

**5) Placement**

This one is easy, put it in your tax advantaged accounts. My question is, is there a good position or opportunity in a taxable account? I would put it in a taxable account if I needed to withdraw the dividend income (not DRIP). Unfortunately I live in California so I am dicked. 

**My question:** Can anyone think of a scenario/strategy where taxation would be mitigated or even somewhat effective? More specifically and in addition to, when/how would you put in a taxable account? Please don't say when you  have no additional room in your tax-advantaged. That is assumed in this question.

investing,"Nextech AR Solutions (NEXCF)

I'll make this quick and start off by saying I'm a rookie with regard to the stock market but have done my fair share of research into smaller / ""off the radar"" companies poised with interesting opportunities and lucrative potential.

I was first introduced to NEXCF right before their big blastoff breakout, 52-week high price after news of their launch of 3D augmented reality (3D/AR) solution for online eCommerce product placement advertising.

The CEO of the company seems to have always been, most especially in recent weeks, an active member of the shareholder community and stands behind his brand. There have been plenty of online press releases detailing his investments and purchases of company shares -- and just recently purchasing nearly one million shares himself -- so buying his own stuff means things are going well and he's pretty confident about it, right? He also regularly hosts online video conference calls where he welcomes investors and speculators to come in and chat, watch the show and ask questions -- all done in live action! I feel like he's always been very transparent with his company practices and future plans -- which has lead me to be a firm believer of NEXCF.

Not to mention, although NEXCF is labeled as having OTC shares, their reputation precedes themselves by openly reporting acquisitions, partnerships, revenues, profits, etc.

Also looks like volume and share price have been going up somewhat steadily in recent weeks.

investing,"Futures pretty much have been green almost every day these past few weeks, including all of this week. Essentially, there are some smart algos I suspect who are using it as a pump and dump scheme. 

Essentially, futures trade with very little volume vs regular hours. So the algos bid it up with no volume without any resistance, next day it starts higher at the open, and they sell it at higher price into high volume during regular hours. Normally the price would revert back but the issue is there are still retail sending market on buy orders during regular trading hours without looking at price. 

Thus it’s causing a lot of interesting things. These future traders are actually just buying low and selling higher most days. That’s why the average movement has been like a green open and then it sells off intraday (but it closes generally still higher than when these future traders first bought). Since overall these algos get out risk free end of day and there are still retail buying, we get a melt up with net more buyers. 

This wouldn’t work if retail wasn’t still sending market buy orders indiscriminately of price, but they do that. The average institution, pension fund, or retail are sending market on open or close buy orders regardless if futures was -1%, 0%, 1%, or whatever %. They’ll just buy at whatever price is offered. This applies to all individual stocks too since most are correlated with futures. 

This phenomenon might break occasionally once we have some overnight news or some large firm wants to liquidate through futures, but on average, these guys are making money and causing a slow melt up lately.

I’ve followed this pattern all week after noticing it last week and as long as I buy at close and sell at middle of day next day when the retail have sent their market orders beginning of the day, I’ve made money on average. 

It’s completely manipulation in my opinion but there are some funds out there doing this, and you just have to follow the pattern.","On average, futures are being used as a market pump and dump scheme, which is causing a slow melt up."
