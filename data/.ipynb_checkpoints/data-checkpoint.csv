I want to start off by saying this post is not intended to come off as lazy. I really want to learn how to put finding these things to good use.

(I know everyone is still in it for purely their own gains, but it seems everyone here genuinely wants to help each other).

But what do you do with those numbers when you have them? What do they mean? How do you relate them to DD, and what even is a GOOD DD?

7,stocks,"Hey, so I’m new to trading and wanted to clarify on washes. I understand it’s to prevent people from tax deductions so you can’t sell at a loss and then buy the company that you sold within 30 days. However what happens if you buy two lots of a stock at different price points. Say one buys 100 shares of AAPL at 200$ in January, and 100 shares of AAPL at 100$ in February. If the stock price is currently trading at let’s say 130$, could you sell your 100 shares bought in February (for a 30$ profit) or would that be considered a wash because it’s at a loss for your average price between your stocks? (which would be valued at 150$ per stock of which you own 200 total). This is all assuming you want to buy again after. Thanks guys, sorry if this question was confusing!",Question on how washes work

17,stocks,"Hey everyone. 

We all know what Disney+ has done to DIS stock. Even with the virus shutting down the parks, ESPN having nothing to show, DIS is doing pretty great thanks to its streaming service Disney+. 

DIS has essentially become a meme stock. There has been tons of hype and chat on reddit and other forums about it. 

However, I never see any HBO MAX or AT&amp;T hype. WarnerMedia has a MASSIVE array of entertainment companies and content under its belt. It’s launching soon but it hasn’t gotten as much hype on stock forums.

Based on the lack of discussion, I am thinking it’s not yet priced in. I’ve bought shares in AT&amp;T hoping to see them spike in June when HBO MAX announces number of new subscribers. 

I’m thinking with new subscribers, some “analysts” hyping it, and eventually more discussion on forums - maybe it’ll become a new meme stock like DIS. I also think the number of HBO MAX subscribers will continue to grow after its launch, as they will eventually start pulling their content from Netflix and Hulu (I assume).

Summarized

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.

44,stocks,"After losing a war with options (lost $1,500), I swore off using options as a get rich quick scheme. It makes for cool WSB gain posts, can’t deny that. But I was terrible at it so I swore it off. 

Recently I decided it would be smart to invest 15-20k in RTX with hope that it would go back to its COVID upside of $66-$67 (I bought in at $59). 

Theoretically if I sold my shares at a price target of $68-70 I’d profit almost $2,000 which is almost an entire months income for me (college grad with shit salary). 

I’ve been thinking of repeating this process in the future with other blue chip stocks I believe in, with the purpose of simply holding it up to a month and selling it within that time frame to clinch profits of about $2,000 at a time give or take. 
￼

This would help me so much. It would essentially give me double the income that I have now, and wouldn’t require me picking up an extra job, plus I really enjoy the market. 

I know that a lot of this hinges on the market moving in my favor within 4 weeks, but realistically I think it could be pulled off most months (it’s been one and half weeks since I invested in RTX, in that time it dropped to $50 and moved back up to almost my break even price of $58)

Do you think this is a bad method for increasing my income steadily in the stock market?

Should I be splitting this 15-20k or buying power into two or three blue chip stocks to diversify? Theoretically it sounds like it would be better, but also I would have to keep tabs on three different companies which is more work and time consuming. And there’s always a chance that multiple or all of my trades end up going down and costing me time waiting for them to break even.

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",The Bearish Case for Stocks

Hi guys,

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

57,stocks,"It's not pretty out there in value investing land.  Most have gone full Growth At Any Price while the rest are panicking.

These guys are demanding that management cut expenses, buyback stock, and start investing in the future, all of which management is doing very well.  They've bought back 40% of the stock and have taken a break from that to buyback their remaining debt for 70c on the Dollar.  They've slashed headcount and compensation to the bone while restoring productivity and cleaning up both the debt and current assets &amp; liabilities.  The balance sheet will be pristine once they pay off the last of this debt.

Revenue fell by a fifth last year, and everyone's going to pieces over it.  Meanwhile, even NPD is admitting that console sales for Xbox and PlayStation have collapsed by the same rate as GME's because they delayed the launches by yet another year after a record length in the console cycle.  All of that lost revenue constituted the entirety of last year's would-be profits.  If GME's failing right now, so are the console divisions of SNE and MSFT even though they historically are 2/3 to 3/4 of total industry units and revenue.

In times like these when value stocks are the cheapest they've ever been, it's fun to see who really has what it takes to be a true value investor.  Even Toby Carlisle's sidekick Bill Brewster just threw in the towel because he thinks value no longer works while it sits at the biggest spread to glamour since the 2000 and 1929 bubbles.

Let's see if the shareholders are just as jumpy and vote for the guys who claim they'll restore the company to glory by paying both management and non-executives nothing and borrowing recklessly to buyback stock as they take credit for the potential $10 billion in sales this year, based upon catch up demand.",Someone should tell Hestia &amp; Permit the only reason why there weren't any profits at GME last year was because no one was buying Xboxes and PlayStations

Wall Street had priced in an earnings beat as TTWO has risen over 10% in the last 10 days but numbers this good weren't expected. Currently up another 2%+ in after hours trading. 

TTWO is an independent video game publisher and the company behind titles like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Sid Meier's Civilization, and NBA 2K.

Financially, they are in great shape. No debt, solid cash flow, and a strong track record of success releasing both new titles and sequels. There was concern that they would underperform in 2020 as they have no major titles set for release this year but Covid turned out to be a boon as sales are up 41% over last year.

175,stocks,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

226,stocks,"Growth stocks commonly have a very high price to earnings ratio if they make a profit at all. They have a price to book ratio much larger than one. And their sales are pretty small compared to the market cap.

So overall, things would need to change drastically (let's say sales need to increase tenfold or even more!) for these companies to reach valuations comparable to more established companies.

It is actually very common that these companies operate in markets that do not even allow such growth.

So the only way to consider these stocks fair market value is if the stock itself (and the growth of the stock) is the product of the company and not its actual business. The promise to get rich. At that point it really becomes hard to distinguish these stocks from a pyramid scheme. 

Now, if these more established companies would not exist, I would understand why people are investing in growth. But if the best case scenario is what the established companies have already become, I find it hard to not lose faith in the market.

235,stocks,"Take this as advice, a rant, a sob story, or whatever you'd like, but I want to share how I believe I was screwed several times by investing in JCP unsecured bonds (JBN).

1. Coronavirus - Yeah, everyone got burned a little, but several companies in the retail sector were forced into bankruptcy with no real help because of it, JCP one of them. Yeah, it was risky to begin with, but I did my due diligence. I *knew* that JCP wouldn't go BK until 2023 at the earliest. Who knew government would force companies to shut down by no fault of their own for 2+ months and then not bail them out? Seriously, I normally like Trump, but I think he wants retail to burn because Macy's stopped selling his ties in 2016 and he never forgot about it.
2. Execs pulling a fast one - At least everyone in the company suffered, including execs w/ equity in the company, right? Wrong. A couple days before BK, the top brass cut themselves a deal, paying millions to retain themselves with the caveat of giving up equity/performance bonuses in the company, which they knew was worthless with bankruptcy imminent. The whole point of giving the top brass payment in the form of shares is to incentivize them to do what's best for the shareholders because they're in the same boat. If they can just pay themselves out and jump ship, then it was all an illusion. Not only that, but their millions were paid out with money that would have went to bondholders. Why are they worth retaining? I had some faith in Jill, but all she really did was reverse decisions of horrible CEOs before her and downsize, cutting poor performing stores. She never got to the point of implementing anything new to help the company become profitable and grow.
3. Locking the shares - During this BK, a small sliver of light presented itself when AMZN hinted at buying JCP, something which would likely bring some value greater than what a bankruptcy agreement would. However, instead of letting people who want to take the risk take it and those who would be happy to cash out on the hype cash out, the symbol was locked, both the bond and the stock (Symbol is now JCPNQ btw).

I write this because I never expected so much interference in a system that is supposed to be a FREE MARKET. Point 2 is less of an attack on the free market and more of just blatant corruption. There are rules to stop insider trading when things are going on behind the scenes, yet this payout seems like obvious loophole to that. I had A LOT of my eggs in this basket, so I'm hurting right now and just praying for a AMZN deal that helps unsecured bondholders. I needed to vent a little, but hopefully it provides some value to someone with the lesson that no one is on your side, company executives or government, even if they pretend to be.",How my situation with JCP made me lose faith in the free market.
236,stocks,"I lost probably around 12k on a garbage scam stock called BXC last year. But if I didn’t sell when I did ($22), I would have lost it all. It’s currently trading at $5. I ended up meeting one of their largest investors in person long after I sold and he said word for word “they have no idea what they are doing over there.”

242,stocks,"Im from Europe and I’ve been using Trading 212, and i mostly day trade. The platform is easy to use and have a great demo simulator.

I inserted a realistic amount in the demo account which was 500€. Everyday I managed to get a profit of 50-100€, sometimes even up to 150€. I used Germany 30 (Index) to trade with and the leverage was 1/500, I always bought 1,2 shares (one share costs 11.000€). 

Because of leverage I managed to get good profit everyday but was risky sometimes ngl, thats why I never went over 1,2 shares.

But when I opened my real account. The leverage went from 1/500 to 1/30 and I might insert 200€ instead.

I do know that my profit would be much less, because of less leverage and smaller account. But I don’t mind that, because this will make it less risky and I’m young as well and want to take thing slow.

Anyways my question is will I get same amount of % profit if i buy/short 0,03 shares of the same market/index (Germany 30)?

Here is a better explanation

Here is the math (tell me if I’m wrong)

11.000€ per share (Germany 30)

When I used demo: 
Leverage; 1/500

I bought 1,2 shares

= 11.000*1.2=13.200€
= 13.200/500=26,4€

26,4€ is how much a 1,2 share would cost me with 1/500 leverage

26,4/500*100=5,28% 

This means that I used 5.28% of my (fake) 500€ money and made me get approximately 75€ everyday.

If I use my real account:
Leverage; 1/30

Thinking on buying only 0,03 shares
= 11.000*0.03=330€
= 330/30=11€

11€ is how much a 0,03 share would cost me with 1/30 leverage

11/200*100=5,5%

This means that I will use 5,5% of my real 200€ money and will make me (75/500*100=15% profit) 15% profit of 200€=30€. So approximately 30€ profit everyday right?

Am I doing the math right? Is this approximately how much profit I will get with a 200€ account with 1/30 leverage? I might be right but I really don’t wanna mess things up before I start",Just opened my trading account after 5+ weeks of using demo account. I got some questions before I start properly.

300,stocks,"I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

324,stocks,"Obviously this isn't a flashy name and what they sell isn't sexy but hear me out. This company makes all the random shit you see in grocery stores, food stalls, cafeterias, movie theaters, stadiums: Super Pretzels, ICEE, Slush Puppie, churros, minute maid popsicles, funnel cakes, italian ice, bakery goods, etc. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service (#1 revenue stream), Frozen Beverages (#2) , and Retail Supermarket (#3).

Since 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. Now enter in the beer flu, that streak will snap as everything they sell into is closed except for supermarket. Q1 earnings, as expected, were trash:

- Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
- Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
- Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)


Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year.  Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year.  Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago. 

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.  

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

Hi

I recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.

Now market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.

1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.
2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam
3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.

As for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.

For IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.

All in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",Is IBD a SCAM.?(Investor Business Daily Review)

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.

“A year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented,” says [Peter Hotez](https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/peter-hotez-m-d-ph-d/b1846a47-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6), dean at Baylor University’s National School of Tropical Medicine. “Maybe with the new technology, maybe with throwing enough money on it, that'll happen.

We all know what Disney+ has done to DIS stock. Even with the virus shutting down the parks, ESPN having nothing to show, DIS is doing pretty great thanks to its streaming service Disney+. 

DIS has essentially become a meme stock. There has been tons of hype and chat on reddit and other forums about it. 

However, I never see any HBO MAX or AT&amp;T hype. WarnerMedia has a MASSIVE array of entertainment companies and content under its belt. It’s launching soon but it hasn’t gotten as much hype on stock forums.

Based on the lack of discussion, I am thinking it’s not yet priced in. I’ve bought shares in AT&amp;T hoping to see them spike in June when HBO MAX announces number of new subscribers. 

I’m thinking with new subscribers, some “analysts” hyping it, and eventually more discussion on forums - maybe it’ll become a new meme stock like DIS.

Summarized

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.

545,stocks,"After losing a war with options (lost $1,500), I swore off using options as a get rich quick scheme. It makes for cool WSB gain posts, can’t deny that. But I was terrible at it so I swore it off. 

Recently I decided it would be smart to invest 15-20k in RTX with hope that it would go back to its COVID upside of $66-$67 (I bought in at $59). 

Theoretically if I sold my shares at a price target of $68-70 I’d profit almost $2,000 which is almost an entire months income for me (college grad with shit salary). 

I’ve been thinking of repeating this process in the future with other blue chip stocks I believe in, with the purpose of simply holding it up to a month and selling it within that time frame to clinch profits of about $2,000 at a time give or take. 
￼

This would help me so much. It would essentially give me double the income that I have now, and wouldn’t require me picking up an extra job, plus I really enjoy the market. 

I know that a lot of this hinges on the market moving in my favor within 4 weeks, but realistically I think it could be pulled off most months (it’s been one and half weeks since I invested in RTX, in that time it dropped to $50 and moved back up to almost my break even price of $58)

Do you think this is a bad method for increasing my income steadily in the stock market?

Should I be splitting this 15-20k or buying power into two or three blue chip stocks to diversify? Theoretically it sounds like it would be better, but also I would have to keep tabs on three different companies which is more work and time consuming. And there’s always a chance that multiple or all of my trades end up going down and costing me time waiting for them to break even.

Many people were saying stocks were overvalued (or at least a bit frothy in 2019), but now (going into the most cataclysmic economic event of our lifetimes), it is a good time to buy??

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",The Bearish Case for Stocks

Hi guys,

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

558,stocks,"It's not pretty out there in value investing land.  Most have gone full Growth At Any Price while the rest are panicking.

These guys are demanding that management cut expenses, buyback stock, and start investing in the future, all of which management is doing very well.  They've bought back 40% of the stock and have taken a break from that to buyback their remaining debt for 70c on the Dollar.  They've slashed headcount and compensation to the bone while restoring productivity and cleaning up both the debt and current assets &amp; liabilities.  The balance sheet will be pristine once they pay off the last of this debt.

Revenue fell by a fifth last year, and everyone's going to pieces over it.  Meanwhile, even NPD is admitting that console sales for Xbox and PlayStation have collapsed by the same rate as GME's because they delayed the launches by yet another year after a record length in the console cycle.  All of that lost revenue constituted the entirety of last year's would-be profits.  If GME's failing right now, so are the console divisions of SNE and MSFT even though they historically are 2/3 to 3/4 of total industry units and revenue.

In times like these when value stocks are the cheapest they've ever been, it's fun to see who really has what it takes to be a true value investor.  Even Toby Carlisle's sidekick Bill Brewster just threw in the towel because he thinks value no longer works while it sits at the biggest spread to glamour since the 2000 and 1929 bubbles.

Let's see if the shareholders are just as jumpy and vote for the guys who claim they'll restore the company to glory by paying both management and non-executives nothing and borrowing recklessly to buyback stock as they take credit for the potential $10 billion in sales this year, based upon catch up demand.",Someone should tell Hestia &amp; Permit the only reason why there weren't any profits at GME last year was because no one was buying Xboxes and PlayStations

Wall Street had priced in an earnings beat as TTWO has risen over 10% in the last 10 days but numbers this good weren't expected. Currently up another 2%+ in after hours trading. 

TTWO is an independent video game publisher and the company behind titles like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Sid Meier's Civilization, and NBA 2K. They are known for longer development times and quality games compared to other shops like Activision and Electronic Arts who are notorious for shipping incomplete games needing significant patching that are filled with microtransactions.

Financially, they are in great shape. No debt, solid cash flow, and a strong track record of success releasing both new titles and sequels. There was concern that they would underperform in 2020 as they have no major titles set for release this year but Covid turned out to be a boon as sales are up 41% over last year. 

I hold TTWO and will continue holding on to it. Very solid, well run company.

676,stocks,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

So it's a very risky play, but picking up a company that is still in operation at a fraction of its IPO price (which I'm assuming is closer to the real value at the time, pre book cooking, although I could be wrong) is kind of attractive.

694,stocks,"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

696,stocks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a reimagining of life in the developed world to a far greater extent than most anything since World War II. As we endure this collective battle, there are few subjects that spark populist anger more than personal protection equipment (PPE) and its lack of availability for frontline workers – not to mention the average household.

The most important of this class of object is probably the N95 mask. The importance of these masks is well summarized by the fact that healthcare information sources have gone so far as to attempt to convince Joe Public that they don’t work to protect the wearer from airborne droplets carrying SARS-CoV-2 microbial agents because we need to make sure frontline responders have access to a sufficient supply, and authorities are desperately afraid of hoarding among the general public.

The masks do work, and we don’t have enough of them.

That creates a terrible reality. But it also creates an opportunity for those nasty capitalists among us who understand that they might invest their own savings in companies offering solutions to this whole mess, thereby helping to save the world with abject greed.

I started using TDAmeritrade for my first time investing last week. Last Thursday I believe. I deposited 4k right away with the intent to invest in two companies that hit a low, but know they will go back up. So, I deposited right away and on Friday afternoon, or so, I bought 2k of one company just to get started. This is the first truly investing myself, so I am learning as I go. Anyways, my funds weren't cleared at the time. I guess they will clear this Thursday, for whatever reason. I then bought a few hundred of another company yesterday leaving me with around $1500 that I have not touched. My question is on margins...

&amp;#x200B;

As my money hasn't cleared, is that why I have all sorts of margin deductions and numbers? I've always heard negative things about them, and want to make sure I use my cash only. I am up a few hundred dollars on top of the 4k I deposited in, but I want to make sure that once my cash does clear, it will fix my margin stuff, because that doesn't make sense and I want to make sure its my money I'm using and not borrowed money, if that makes sense..

727,stocks,"Growth stocks commonly have a very high price to earnings ratio if they make a profit at all. They have a price to book ratio much larger than one. And their sales are pretty small compared to the market cap.

So overall, things would need to change drastically (let's say sales need to increase tenfold or even more!) for these companies to reach valuations comparable to more established companies.

It is actually very common that these companies operate in markets that do not even allow such growth.

So the only way to consider these stocks fair market value is if the stock itself (and the growth of the stock) is the product of the company and not its actual business. The promise to get rich. At that point it really becomes hard to distinguish these stocks from a pyramid scheme. 

Now, if these more established companies would not exist, I would understand why people are investing in growth. But if the best case scenario is what the established companies have already become, I find it hard to not lose faith in the market.

736,stocks,"Take this as advice, a rant, a sob story, or whatever you'd like, but I want to share how I believe I was screwed several times by investing in JCP unsecured bonds (JBN).

1. Coronavirus - Yeah, everyone got burned a little, but several companies in the retail sector were forced into bankruptcy with no real help because of it, JCP one of them. Yeah, it was risky to begin with, but I did my due diligence. I *knew* that JCP wouldn't go BK until 2023 at the earliest. Who knew government would force companies to shut down by no fault of their own for 2+ months and then not bail them out? Seriously, I normally like Trump, but I think he wants retail to burn because Macy's stopped selling his ties in 2016 and he never forgot about it.
2. Execs pulling a fast one - At least everyone in the company suffered, including execs w/ equity in the company, right? Wrong. A couple days before BK, the top brass cut themselves a deal, paying millions to retain themselves with the caveat of giving up equity/performance bonuses in the company, which they knew was worthless with bankruptcy imminent. The whole point of giving the top brass payment in the form of shares is to incentivize them to do what's best for the shareholders because they're in the same boat. If they can just pay themselves out and jump ship, then it was all an illusion. Not only that, but their millions were paid out with money that would have went to bondholders. Why are they worth retaining? I had some faith in Jill, but all she really did was reverse decisions of horrible CEOs before her and downsize, cutting poor performing stores. She never got to the point of implementing anything new to help the company become profitable and grow.
3. Locking the shares - During this BK, a small sliver of light presented itself when AMZN hinted at buying JCP, something which would likely bring some value greater than what a bankruptcy agreement would. However, instead of letting people who want to take the risk take it and those who would be happy to cash out on the hype cash out, the symbol was locked, both the bond and the stock (Symbol is now JCPNQ btw).

I write this because I never expected so much interference in a system that is supposed to be a FREE MARKET. Point 2 is less of an attack on the free market and more of just blatant corruption. There are rules to stop insider trading when things are going on behind the scenes, yet this payout seems like obvious loophole to that. I had A LOT of my eggs in this basket, so I'm hurting right now and just praying for a AMZN deal that helps unsecured bondholders. I needed to vent a little, but hopefully it provides some value to someone with the lesson that no one is on your side, company executives or government, even if they pretend to be.",How my situation with JCP made me lose faith in the free market.

743,stocks,"Im from Europe and I’ve been using Trading 212, and i mostly day trade. The platform is easy to use and have a great demo simulator.

I inserted a realistic amount in the demo account which was 500€. Everyday I managed to get a profit of 50-100€, sometimes even up to 150€. I used Germany 30 (Index) to trade with and the leverage was 1/500, I always bought 1,2 shares (one share costs 11.000€). 

Because of leverage I managed to get good profit everyday but was risky sometimes ngl, thats why I never went over 1,2 shares.

But when I opened my real account. The leverage went from 1/500 to 1/30 and I might insert 200€ instead.

I do know that my profit would be much less, because of less leverage and smaller account. But I don’t mind that, because this will make it less risky and I’m young as well and want to take thing slow.

Anyways my question is will I get same amount of % profit if i buy/short 0,03 shares of the same market/index (Germany 30)?

Here is a better explanation

Here is the math (tell me if I’m wrong)

11.000€ per share (Germany 30)

When I used demo: 
Leverage; 1/500

I bought 1,2 shares

= 11.000*1.2=13.200€
= 13.200/500=26,4€

26,4€ is how much a 1,2 share would cost me with 1/500 leverage

26,4/500*100=5,28% 

This means that I used 5.28% of my (fake) 500€ money and made me get approximately 75€ everyday.

If I use my real account:
Leverage; 1/30

Thinking on buying only 0,03 shares
= 11.000*0.03=330€
= 330/30=11€

11€ is how much a 0,03 share would cost me with 1/30 leverage

11/200*100=5,5%

This means that I will use 5,5% of my real 200€ money and will make me (75/500*100=15% profit) 15% profit of 200€=30€. So approximately 30€ profit everyday right?

Am I doing the math right? Is this approximately how much profit I will get with a 200€ account with 1/30 leverage? I might be right but I really don’t wanna mess things up before I start",Just opened my trading account after 5+ weeks of using demo account. I got some questions before I start properly.

801,stocks,"I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

This company makes all the random shit you see in grocery stores, food stalls, cafeterias, movie theaters, stadiums: Super Pretzels, ICEE, Slush Puppie, churros, minute maid popsicles, funnel cakes, italian ice, bakery goods, etc. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service (#1 revenue stream), Frozen Beverages (#2) , and Retail Supermarket (#3).

Since 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. Now enter in the beer flu, that streak will snap as everything they sell into is closed except for supermarket. Q1 earnings, as expected, were trash:

- Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
- Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
- Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)


Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year.  Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year.  Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago. 

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.  

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

Hi everyone:

I'm trying to find a website that reports on **big news stories in real-time** and **what is driving the markets in real-time.**

Case  in point: today at \~2:50PM EST, news broke that the Moderna vaccine  results have some problems with it. Stocks plunged between 2:55 PM and  3:00 PM.

News sites reported on this vaccine news with 30-60 min lag, which is far too long if you're trying to daytrade aggressively.

* CNBC reported on the [vaccine news](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/19/experts-say-moderna-didnt-produce-data-critical-to-assessing-vaccine.html) at 3:26 PM.
* Bloomberg [reported on this ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/asia-stocks-to-advance-after-u-s-rally-oil-gains-markets-wrap?srnd=premium)at 3:39 PM.
* SeekingAlpha reported on this at 3:45 PM.
* Yahoo Finance: [4:07 PM](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/coronavirus-latest-tuesday-may-19-193838933.html)
* MarketWatch [didn't report on this](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/european-stocks-and-u-s-futures-edge-lower-after-wild-rally-51589879594?mod=newsviewer_click) until 4:12 PM
* Reuters: [4:38 PM](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/sp-stumbles-as-moderna-sinks-on-report-questioning-trial-results-idUSKBN22V1EH)

The one website I've found so far that does a good job at this is ForexLive, who [reported on this](https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/there-are-some-doubts-about-modernas-vaccine-20200519) at 3:00 PM.

Hi

I recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.

Now market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.

1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.
2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam
3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.

As for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.

For IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.

All in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",Is IBD a SCAM.?(Investor Business Daily Review)

Thank you for getting in touch with us.

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.

“A year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented,” says [Peter Hotez](https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/peter-hotez-m-d-ph-d/b1846a47-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6), dean at Baylor University’s National School of Tropical Medicine. “Maybe with the new technology, maybe with throwing enough money on it, that'll happen.

However what happens if you buy two lots of a stock at different price points. Say one buys 100 shares of AAPL at 200$ in January, and 100 shares of AAPL at 100$ in February. If the stock price is currently trading at let’s say 130$, could you sell your 100 shares bought in February (for a 30$ profit) or would that be considered a wash because it’s at a loss for your average price between your stocks? (which would be valued at 150$ per stock of which you own 200 total). This is all assuming you want to buy again after. Thanks guys, sorry if this question was confusing!",Question on how washes work

1018,stocks,"Hey everyone. 

We all know what Disney+ has done to DIS stock. Even with the virus shutting down the parks, ESPN having nothing to show, DIS is doing pretty great thanks to its streaming service Disney+. 

DIS has essentially become a meme stock. There has been tons of hype and chat on reddit and other forums about it. 

However, I never see any HBO MAX or AT&amp;T hype. WarnerMedia has a MASSIVE array of entertainment companies and content under its belt. It’s launching soon but it hasn’t gotten as much hype on stock forums.

Based on the lack of discussion, I am thinking it’s not yet priced in. I’ve bought shares in AT&amp;T hoping to see them spike in June when HBO MAX announces number of new subscribers. 

I’m thinking with new subscribers, some “analysts” hyping it, and eventually more discussion on forums - maybe it’ll become a new meme stock like DIS. I also think the number of HBO MAX subscribers will continue to grow after its launch, as they will eventually start pulling their content from Netflix and Hulu (I assume).

Summarized

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.

1045,stocks,"After losing a war with options (lost $1,500), I swore off using options as a get rich quick scheme. It makes for cool WSB gain posts, can’t deny that. But I was terrible at it so I swore it off. 

Recently I decided it would be smart to invest 15-20k in RTX with hope that it would go back to its COVID upside of $66-$67 (I bought in at $59). 

Theoretically if I sold my shares at a price target of $68-70 I’d profit almost $2,000 which is almost an entire months income for me (college grad with shit salary). 

I’ve been thinking of repeating this process in the future with other blue chip stocks I believe in, with the purpose of simply holding it up to a month and selling it within that time frame to clinch profits of about $2,000 at a time give or take. 
￼

This would help me so much. It would essentially give me double the income that I have now, and wouldn’t require me picking up an extra job, plus I really enjoy the market. 

I know that a lot of this hinges on the market moving in my favor within 4 weeks, but realistically I think it could be pulled off most months (it’s been one and half weeks since I invested in RTX, in that time it dropped to $50 and moved back up to almost my break even price of $58)

Do you think this is a bad method for increasing my income steadily in the stock market?

Should I be splitting this 15-20k or buying power into two or three blue chip stocks to diversify? Theoretically it sounds like it would be better, but also I would have to keep tabs on three different companies which is more work and time consuming. And there’s always a chance that multiple or all of my trades end up going down and costing me time waiting for them to break even.

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",The Bearish Case for Stocks

Hi guys,

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

These guys are demanding that management cut expenses, buyback stock, and start investing in the future, all of which management is doing very well.  They've bought back 40% of the stock and have taken a break from that to buyback their remaining debt for 70c on the Dollar.  They've slashed headcount and compensation to the bone while restoring productivity and cleaning up both the debt and current assets &amp; liabilities.  The balance sheet will be pristine once they pay off the last of this debt.

Revenue fell by a fifth last year, and everyone's going to pieces over it.  Meanwhile, even NPD is admitting that console sales for Xbox and PlayStation have collapsed by the same rate as GME's because they delayed the launches by yet another year after a record length in the console cycle.  All of that lost revenue constituted the entirety of last year's would-be profits.  If GME's failing right now, so are the console divisions of SNE and MSFT even though they historically are 2/3 to 3/4 of total industry units and revenue.

In times like these when value stocks are the cheapest they've ever been, it's fun to see who really has what it takes to be a true value investor.

Financially, they are in great shape. No debt, solid cash flow, and a strong track record of success releasing both new titles and sequels. There was concern that they would underperform in 2020 as they have no major titles set for release this year but Covid turned out to be a boon as sales are up 41% over last year.

Very new to trading,don't have much disposable income, but decided to buy my first shares a month ago (22nd April). Put in 500$ bought shares in energy companies.

We all saw what peleton did in the last month. Logically we should see the same trend with bike company. As an alternative to gym, outdoors activities and transport, bike sales could possibly surges this summer.

1176,stocks,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

So, I deposited right away and on Friday afternoon, or so, I bought 2k of one company just to get started. This is the first truly investing myself, so I am learning as I go.

1227,stocks,"Growth stocks commonly have a very high price to earnings ratio if they make a profit at all. They have a price to book ratio much larger than one. And their sales are pretty small compared to the market cap.

So overall, things would need to change drastically (let's say sales need to increase tenfold or even more!) for these companies to reach valuations comparable to more established companies.

It is actually very common that these companies operate in markets that do not even allow such growth.

So the only way to consider these stocks fair market value is if the stock itself (and the growth of the stock) is the product of the company and not its actual business. The promise to get rich. At that point it really becomes hard to distinguish these stocks from a pyramid scheme. 

Now, if these more established companies would not exist, I would understand why people are investing in growth. But if the best case scenario is what the established companies have already become, I find it hard to not lose faith in the market.

1236,stocks,"Take this as advice, a rant, a sob story, or whatever you'd like, but I want to share how I believe I was screwed several times by investing in JCP unsecured bonds (JBN).

1. Coronavirus - Yeah, everyone got burned a little, but several companies in the retail sector were forced into bankruptcy with no real help because of it, JCP one of them. Yeah, it was risky to begin with, but I did my due diligence. I *knew* that JCP wouldn't go BK until 2023 at the earliest. Who knew government would force companies to shut down by no fault of their own for 2+ months and then not bail them out? Seriously, I normally like Trump, but I think he wants retail to burn because Macy's stopped selling his ties in 2016 and he never forgot about it.
2. Execs pulling a fast one - At least everyone in the company suffered, including execs w/ equity in the company, right? Wrong. A couple days before BK, the top brass cut themselves a deal, paying millions to retain themselves with the caveat of giving up equity/performance bonuses in the company, which they knew was worthless with bankruptcy imminent. The whole point of giving the top brass payment in the form of shares is to incentivize them to do what's best for the shareholders because they're in the same boat. If they can just pay themselves out and jump ship, then it was all an illusion. Not only that, but their millions were paid out with money that would have went to bondholders. Why are they worth retaining? I had some faith in Jill, but all she really did was reverse decisions of horrible CEOs before her and downsize, cutting poor performing stores. She never got to the point of implementing anything new to help the company become profitable and grow.
3. Locking the shares - During this BK, a small sliver of light presented itself when AMZN hinted at buying JCP, something which would likely bring some value greater than what a bankruptcy agreement would. However, instead of letting people who want to take the risk take it and those who would be happy to cash out on the hype cash out, the symbol was locked, both the bond and the stock (Symbol is now JCPNQ btw).

I write this because I never expected so much interference in a system that is supposed to be a FREE MARKET. Point 2 is less of an attack on the free market and more of just blatant corruption. There are rules to stop insider trading when things are going on behind the scenes, yet this payout seems like obvious loophole to that. I had A LOT of my eggs in this basket, so I'm hurting right now and just praying for a AMZN deal that helps unsecured bondholders. I needed to vent a little, but hopefully it provides some value to someone with the lesson that no one is on your side, company executives or government, even if they pretend to be.",How my situation with JCP made me lose faith in the free market.
1237,stocks,"I lost probably around 12k on a garbage scam stock called BXC last year. But if I didn’t sell when I did ($22), I would have lost it all. It’s currently trading at $5.

1243,stocks,"Im from Europe and I’ve been using Trading 212, and i mostly day trade. The platform is easy to use and have a great demo simulator.

I inserted a realistic amount in the demo account which was 500€. Everyday I managed to get a profit of 50-100€, sometimes even up to 150€. I used Germany 30 (Index) to trade with and the leverage was 1/500, I always bought 1,2 shares (one share costs 11.000€). 

Because of leverage I managed to get good profit everyday but was risky sometimes ngl, thats why I never went over 1,2 shares.

But when I opened my real account. The leverage went from 1/500 to 1/30 and I might insert 200€ instead.

I do know that my profit would be much less, because of less leverage and smaller account. But I don’t mind that, because this will make it less risky and I’m young as well and want to take thing slow.

Anyways my question is will I get same amount of % profit if i buy/short 0,03 shares of the same market/index (Germany 30)?

Here is a better explanation

Here is the math (tell me if I’m wrong)

11.000€ per share (Germany 30)

When I used demo: 
Leverage; 1/500

I bought 1,2 shares

= 11.000*1.2=13.200€
= 13.200/500=26,4€

26,4€ is how much a 1,2 share would cost me with 1/500 leverage

26,4/500*100=5,28% 

This means that I used 5.28% of my (fake) 500€ money and made me get approximately 75€ everyday.

If I use my real account:
Leverage; 1/30

Thinking on buying only 0,03 shares
= 11.000*0.03=330€
= 330/30=11€

11€ is how much a 0,03 share would cost me with 1/30 leverage

11/200*100=5,5%

This means that I will use 5,5% of my real 200€ money and will make me (75/500*100=15% profit) 15% profit of 200€=30€. So approximately 30€ profit everyday right?

Am I doing the math right? Is this approximately how much profit I will get with a 200€ account with 1/30 leverage? I might be right but I really don’t wanna mess things up before I start",Just opened my trading account after 5+ weeks of using demo account. I got some questions before I start properly.

1301,stocks,"I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

1325,stocks,"Obviously this isn't a flashy name and what they sell isn't sexy but hear me out. This company makes all the random shit you see in grocery stores, food stalls, cafeterias, movie theaters, stadiums: Super Pretzels, ICEE, Slush Puppie, churros, minute maid popsicles, funnel cakes, italian ice, bakery goods, etc. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service (#1 revenue stream), Frozen Beverages (#2) , and Retail Supermarket (#3).

Since 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. Now enter in the beer flu, that streak will snap as everything they sell into is closed except for supermarket. Q1 earnings, as expected, were trash:

- Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
- Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
- Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)


Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year.  Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year.  Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago. 

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.  

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

Hi

I recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.

Now market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.

1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.
2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam
3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.

As for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.

For IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.

All in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",Is IBD a SCAM.?(Investor Business Daily Review)

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.

We all know what Disney+ has done to DIS stock. Even with the virus shutting down the parks, ESPN having nothing to show, DIS is doing pretty great thanks to its streaming service Disney+. 

DIS has essentially become a meme stock. There has been tons of hype and chat on reddit and other forums about it. 

However, I never see any HBO MAX or AT&amp;T hype. WarnerMedia has a MASSIVE array of entertainment companies and content under its belt. It’s launching soon but it hasn’t gotten as much hype on stock forums.

Based on the lack of discussion, I am thinking it’s not yet priced in. I’ve bought shares in AT&amp;T hoping to see them spike in June when HBO MAX announces number of new subscribers. 

I’m thinking with new subscribers, some “analysts” hyping it, and eventually more discussion on forums - maybe it’ll become a new meme stock like DIS.

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.

1544,stocks,"After losing a war with options (lost $1,500), I swore off using options as a get rich quick scheme. It makes for cool WSB gain posts, can’t deny that. But I was terrible at it so I swore it off. 

Recently I decided it would be smart to invest 15-20k in RTX with hope that it would go back to its COVID upside of $66-$67 (I bought in at $59). 

Theoretically if I sold my shares at a price target of $68-70 I’d profit almost $2,000 which is almost an entire months income for me (college grad with shit salary). 

I’ve been thinking of repeating this process in the future with other blue chip stocks I believe in, with the purpose of simply holding it up to a month and selling it within that time frame to clinch profits of about $2,000 at a time give or take. 
￼

This would help me so much. It would essentially give me double the income that I have now, and wouldn’t require me picking up an extra job, plus I really enjoy the market. 

I know that a lot of this hinges on the market moving in my favor within 4 weeks, but realistically I think it could be pulled off most months (it’s been one and half weeks since I invested in RTX, in that time it dropped to $50 and moved back up to almost my break even price of $58)

Do you think this is a bad method for increasing my income steadily in the stock market?

Should I be splitting this 15-20k or buying power into two or three blue chip stocks to diversify? Theoretically it sounds like it would be better, but also I would have to keep tabs on three different companies which is more work and time consuming. And there’s always a chance that multiple or all of my trades end up going down and costing me time waiting for them to break even.

Many people were saying stocks were overvalued (or at least a bit frothy in 2019), but now (going into the most cataclysmic economic event of our lifetimes), it is a good time to buy??

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",The Bearish Case for Stocks

Hi guys,

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

1557,stocks,"It's not pretty out there in value investing land.  Most have gone full Growth At Any Price while the rest are panicking.

These guys are demanding that management cut expenses, buyback stock, and start investing in the future, all of which management is doing very well.  They've bought back 40% of the stock and have taken a break from that to buyback their remaining debt for 70c on the Dollar.  They've slashed headcount and compensation to the bone while restoring productivity and cleaning up both the debt and current assets &amp; liabilities.  The balance sheet will be pristine once they pay off the last of this debt.

Revenue fell by a fifth last year, and everyone's going to pieces over it.  Meanwhile, even NPD is admitting that console sales for Xbox and PlayStation have collapsed by the same rate as GME's because they delayed the launches by yet another year after a record length in the console cycle.  All of that lost revenue constituted the entirety of last year's would-be profits.  If GME's failing right now, so are the console divisions of SNE and MSFT even though they historically are 2/3 to 3/4 of total industry units and revenue.

In times like these when value stocks are the cheapest they've ever been, it's fun to see who really has what it takes to be a true value investor.  Even Toby Carlisle's sidekick Bill Brewster just threw in the towel because he thinks value no longer works while it sits at the biggest spread to glamour since the 2000 and 1929 bubbles.

Let's see if the shareholders are just as jumpy and vote for the guys who claim they'll restore the company to glory by paying both management and non-executives nothing and borrowing recklessly to buyback stock as they take credit for the potential $10 billion in sales this year, based upon catch up demand.",Someone should tell Hestia &amp; Permit the only reason why there weren't any profits at GME last year was because no one was buying Xboxes and PlayStations

Wall Street had priced in an earnings beat as TTWO has risen over 10% in the last 10 days but numbers this good weren't expected. Currently up another 2%+ in after hours trading. 

TTWO is an independent video game publisher and the company behind titles like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Sid Meier's Civilization, and NBA 2K. They are known for longer development times and quality games compared to other shops like Activision and Electronic Arts who are notorious for shipping incomplete games needing significant patching that are filled with microtransactions.

Financially, they are in great shape. No debt, solid cash flow, and a strong track record of success releasing both new titles and sequels. There was concern that they would underperform in 2020 as they have no major titles set for release this year but Covid turned out to be a boon as sales are up 41% over last year. 

I hold TTWO and will continue holding on to it. Very solid, well run company.

1675,stocks,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

As we mostly all know, the company was caught cooking the books which lead to all this chaos, and currently Nasdaq is trying to delist it while luckin is appealing the decision.  This likely means the stock wont be delisted for at least three weeks during the appeal.

So it's a very risky play, but picking up a company that is still in operation at a fraction of its IPO price (which I'm assuming is closer to the real value at the time, pre book cooking, although I could be wrong) is kind of attractive.

1693,stocks,"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

As we endure this collective battle, there are few subjects that spark populist anger more than personal protection equipment (PPE) and its lack of availability for frontline workers – not to mention the average household.

The most important of this class of object is probably the N95 mask. The importance of these masks is well summarized by the fact that healthcare information sources have gone so far as to attempt to convince Joe Public that they don’t work to protect the wearer from airborne droplets carrying SARS-CoV-2 microbial agents because we need to make sure frontline responders have access to a sufficient supply, and authorities are desperately afraid of hoarding among the general public.

The masks do work, and we don’t have enough of them.

That creates a terrible reality. But it also creates an opportunity for those nasty capitalists among us who understand that they might invest their own savings in companies offering solutions to this whole mess, thereby helping to save the world with abject greed.

I started using TDAmeritrade for my first time investing last week. Last Thursday I believe. I deposited 4k right away with the intent to invest in two companies that hit a low, but know they will go back up. So, I deposited right away and on Friday afternoon, or so, I bought 2k of one company just to get started. This is the first truly investing myself, so I am learning as I go. Anyways, my funds weren't cleared at the time. I guess they will clear this Thursday, for whatever reason. I then bought a few hundred of another company yesterday leaving me with around $1500 that I have not touched. My question is on margins...

&amp;#x200B;

As my money hasn't cleared, is that why I have all sorts of margin deductions and numbers? I've always heard negative things about them, and want to make sure I use my cash only. I am up a few hundred dollars on top of the 4k I deposited in, but I want to make sure that once my cash does clear, it will fix my margin stuff, because that doesn't make sense and I want to make sure its my money I'm using and not borrowed money, if that makes sense..

1726,stocks,"Growth stocks commonly have a very high price to earnings ratio if they make a profit at all. They have a price to book ratio much larger than one. And their sales are pretty small compared to the market cap.

So overall, things would need to change drastically (let's say sales need to increase tenfold or even more!) for these companies to reach valuations comparable to more established companies.

It is actually very common that these companies operate in markets that do not even allow such growth.

So the only way to consider these stocks fair market value is if the stock itself (and the growth of the stock) is the product of the company and not its actual business. The promise to get rich. At that point it really becomes hard to distinguish these stocks from a pyramid scheme. 

Now, if these more established companies would not exist, I would understand why people are investing in growth. But if the best case scenario is what the established companies have already become, I find it hard to not lose faith in the market.

1735,stocks,"Take this as advice, a rant, a sob story, or whatever you'd like, but I want to share how I believe I was screwed several times by investing in JCP unsecured bonds (JBN).

1. Coronavirus - Yeah, everyone got burned a little, but several companies in the retail sector were forced into bankruptcy with no real help because of it, JCP one of them. Yeah, it was risky to begin with, but I did my due diligence. I *knew* that JCP wouldn't go BK until 2023 at the earliest. Who knew government would force companies to shut down by no fault of their own for 2+ months and then not bail them out? Seriously, I normally like Trump, but I think he wants retail to burn because Macy's stopped selling his ties in 2016 and he never forgot about it.
2. Execs pulling a fast one - At least everyone in the company suffered, including execs w/ equity in the company, right? Wrong. A couple days before BK, the top brass cut themselves a deal, paying millions to retain themselves with the caveat of giving up equity/performance bonuses in the company, which they knew was worthless with bankruptcy imminent. The whole point of giving the top brass payment in the form of shares is to incentivize them to do what's best for the shareholders because they're in the same boat. If they can just pay themselves out and jump ship, then it was all an illusion. Not only that, but their millions were paid out with money that would have went to bondholders. Why are they worth retaining? I had some faith in Jill, but all she really did was reverse decisions of horrible CEOs before her and downsize, cutting poor performing stores. She never got to the point of implementing anything new to help the company become profitable and grow.
3. Locking the shares - During this BK, a small sliver of light presented itself when AMZN hinted at buying JCP, something which would likely bring some value greater than what a bankruptcy agreement would. However, instead of letting people who want to take the risk take it and those who would be happy to cash out on the hype cash out, the symbol was locked, both the bond and the stock (Symbol is now JCPNQ btw).

I write this because I never expected so much interference in a system that is supposed to be a FREE MARKET. Point 2 is less of an attack on the free market and more of just blatant corruption. There are rules to stop insider trading when things are going on behind the scenes, yet this payout seems like obvious loophole to that. I had A LOT of my eggs in this basket, so I'm hurting right now and just praying for a AMZN deal that helps unsecured bondholders. I needed to vent a little, but hopefully it provides some value to someone with the lesson that no one is on your side, company executives or government, even if they pretend to be.",How my situation with JCP made me lose faith in the free market.

1742,stocks,"Im from Europe and I’ve been using Trading 212, and i mostly day trade. The platform is easy to use and have a great demo simulator.

I inserted a realistic amount in the demo account which was 500€. Everyday I managed to get a profit of 50-100€, sometimes even up to 150€. I used Germany 30 (Index) to trade with and the leverage was 1/500, I always bought 1,2 shares (one share costs 11.000€). 

Because of leverage I managed to get good profit everyday but was risky sometimes ngl, thats why I never went over 1,2 shares.

But when I opened my real account. The leverage went from 1/500 to 1/30 and I might insert 200€ instead.

I do know that my profit would be much less, because of less leverage and smaller account. But I don’t mind that, because this will make it less risky and I’m young as well and want to take thing slow.

Anyways my question is will I get same amount of % profit if i buy/short 0,03 shares of the same market/index (Germany 30)?

Here is a better explanation

Here is the math (tell me if I’m wrong)

11.000€ per share (Germany 30)

When I used demo: 
Leverage; 1/500

I bought 1,2 shares

= 11.000*1.2=13.200€
= 13.200/500=26,4€

26,4€ is how much a 1,2 share would cost me with 1/500 leverage

26,4/500*100=5,28% 

This means that I used 5.28% of my (fake) 500€ money and made me get approximately 75€ everyday.

If I use my real account:
Leverage; 1/30

Thinking on buying only 0,03 shares
= 11.000*0.03=330€
= 330/30=11€

11€ is how much a 0,03 share would cost me with 1/30 leverage

11/200*100=5,5%

This means that I will use 5,5% of my real 200€ money and will make me (75/500*100=15% profit) 15% profit of 200€=30€. So approximately 30€ profit everyday right?

Am I doing the math right? Is this approximately how much profit I will get with a 200€ account with 1/30 leverage? I might be right but I really don’t wanna mess things up before I start",Just opened my trading account after 5+ weeks of using demo account. I got some questions before I start properly.

1800,stocks,"I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

1824,stocks,"Obviously this isn't a flashy name and what they sell isn't sexy but hear me out. This company makes all the random shit you see in grocery stores, food stalls, cafeterias, movie theaters, stadiums: Super Pretzels, ICEE, Slush Puppie, churros, minute maid popsicles, funnel cakes, italian ice, bakery goods, etc. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service (#1 revenue stream), Frozen Beverages (#2) , and Retail Supermarket (#3).

Since 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. Now enter in the beer flu, that streak will snap as everything they sell into is closed except for supermarket. Q1 earnings, as expected, were trash:

- Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
- Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
- Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)


Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year.  Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year.  Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago. 

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.  

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

An important follow up, what are your thoughts on the timing of the delisting notice and the fact that luckin shares will no longer be halted and be available for trade tomorrow?

Though sales of $310million were fabricated, Luckin arguably has more value than the stock price currently reflects (contingent on their ability to recover from this PR nightmare).

These questions lie ahead: Will Luckin survive? Will it get dumped to squeeze out retail investors before big money / Chinese investment companies hop in? And what implications follow the delisting notice? Do you see it having any chance of remaining listed or do you think it’ll be gone?

Hi everyone:

I'm trying to find a website that reports on **big news stories in real-time** and **what is driving the markets in real-time.**

Case  in point: today at \~2:50PM EST, news broke that the Moderna vaccine  results have some problems with it. Stocks plunged between 2:55 PM and  3:00 PM.

News sites reported on this vaccine news with 30-60 min lag, which is far too long if you're trying to daytrade aggressively.

* CNBC reported on the [vaccine news](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/19/experts-say-moderna-didnt-produce-data-critical-to-assessing-vaccine.html) at 3:26 PM.
* Bloomberg [reported on this ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/asia-stocks-to-advance-after-u-s-rally-oil-gains-markets-wrap?srnd=premium)at 3:39 PM.
* SeekingAlpha reported on this at 3:45 PM.
* Yahoo Finance: [4:07 PM](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/coronavirus-latest-tuesday-may-19-193838933.html)
* MarketWatch [didn't report on this](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/european-stocks-and-u-s-futures-edge-lower-after-wild-rally-51589879594?mod=newsviewer_click) until 4:12 PM
* Reuters: [4:38 PM](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/sp-stumbles-as-moderna-sinks-on-report-questioning-trial-results-idUSKBN22V1EH)

Hi

I recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.

Now market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.

1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.
2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam
3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.

As for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.

For IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.

All in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",Is IBD a SCAM.?(Investor Business Daily Review)

I've read and learned quite a bit in terms of suggested allocations within an equity portfolio. However, and perhaps because this is so obvious, I can't seem to find anything confirming how the percentage should be calculated. Is it based on

1. the number of shares you own, regardless of the value of each stock, relative to the total number of shares in your portfolio, or 
2. the value of shares you have in one company/ETF, regardless of the number of shares you hold in that company/ETF, relative to the total value of your portfolio?

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.

If the stock price is currently trading at let’s say 130$, could you sell your 100 shares bought in February (for a 30$ profit) or would that be considered a wash because it’s at a loss for your average price between your stocks?

2018,stocks,"Hey everyone. 

We all know what Disney+ has done to DIS stock. Even with the virus shutting down the parks, ESPN having nothing to show, DIS is doing pretty great thanks to its streaming service Disney+. 

DIS has essentially become a meme stock. There has been tons of hype and chat on reddit and other forums about it. 

However, I never see any HBO MAX or AT&amp;T hype. WarnerMedia has a MASSIVE array of entertainment companies and content under its belt. It’s launching soon but it hasn’t gotten as much hype on stock forums.

Based on the lack of discussion, I am thinking it’s not yet priced in. I’ve bought shares in AT&amp;T hoping to see them spike in June when HBO MAX announces number of new subscribers. 

I’m thinking with new subscribers, some “analysts” hyping it, and eventually more discussion on forums - maybe it’ll become a new meme stock like DIS. I also think the number of HBO MAX subscribers will continue to grow after its launch, as they will eventually start pulling their content from Netflix and Hulu (I assume).

Summarized

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.

2045,stocks,"After losing a war with options (lost $1,500), I swore off using options as a get rich quick scheme. It makes for cool WSB gain posts, can’t deny that. But I was terrible at it so I swore it off. 

Recently I decided it would be smart to invest 15-20k in RTX with hope that it would go back to its COVID upside of $66-$67 (I bought in at $59). 

Theoretically if I sold my shares at a price target of $68-70 I’d profit almost $2,000 which is almost an entire months income for me (college grad with shit salary). 

I’ve been thinking of repeating this process in the future with other blue chip stocks I believe in, with the purpose of simply holding it up to a month and selling it within that time frame to clinch profits of about $2,000 at a time give or take. 
￼

This would help me so much. It would essentially give me double the income that I have now, and wouldn’t require me picking up an extra job, plus I really enjoy the market. 

I know that a lot of this hinges on the market moving in my favor within 4 weeks, but realistically I think it could be pulled off most months (it’s been one and half weeks since I invested in RTX, in that time it dropped to $50 and moved back up to almost my break even price of $58)

Do you think this is a bad method for increasing my income steadily in the stock market?

Should I be splitting this 15-20k or buying power into two or three blue chip stocks to diversify? Theoretically it sounds like it would be better, but also I would have to keep tabs on three different companies which is more work and time consuming. And there’s always a chance that multiple or all of my trades end up going down and costing me time waiting for them to break even.

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",The Bearish Case for Stocks

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

2058,stocks,"It's not pretty out there in value investing land.  Most have gone full Growth At Any Price while the rest are panicking.

These guys are demanding that management cut expenses, buyback stock, and start investing in the future, all of which management is doing very well.  They've bought back 40% of the stock and have taken a break from that to buyback their remaining debt for 70c on the Dollar.  They've slashed headcount and compensation to the bone while restoring productivity and cleaning up both the debt and current assets &amp; liabilities.  The balance sheet will be pristine once they pay off the last of this debt.

Revenue fell by a fifth last year, and everyone's going to pieces over it.  Meanwhile, even NPD is admitting that console sales for Xbox and PlayStation have collapsed by the same rate as GME's because they delayed the launches by yet another year after a record length in the console cycle.  All of that lost revenue constituted the entirety of last year's would-be profits.  If GME's failing right now, so are the console divisions of SNE and MSFT even though they historically are 2/3 to 3/4 of total industry units and revenue.

In times like these when value stocks are the cheapest they've ever been, it's fun to see who really has what it takes to be a true value investor.  Even Toby Carlisle's sidekick Bill Brewster just threw in the towel because he thinks value no longer works while it sits at the biggest spread to glamour since the 2000 and 1929 bubbles.

Let's see if the shareholders are just as jumpy and vote for the guys who claim they'll restore the company to glory by paying both management and non-executives nothing and borrowing recklessly to buyback stock as they take credit for the potential $10 billion in sales this year, based upon catch up demand.",Someone should tell Hestia &amp; Permit the only reason why there weren't any profits at GME last year was because no one was buying Xboxes and PlayStations

Wall Street had priced in an earnings beat as TTWO has risen over 10% in the last 10 days but numbers this good weren't expected. Currently up another 2%+ in after hours trading. 

TTWO is an independent video game publisher and the company behind titles like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Sid Meier's Civilization, and NBA 2K. They are known for longer development times and quality games compared to other shops like Activision and Electronic Arts who are notorious for shipping incomplete games needing significant patching that are filled with microtransactions.

Financially, they are in great shape. No debt, solid cash flow, and a strong track record of success releasing both new titles and sequels. There was concern that they would underperform in 2020 as they have no major titles set for release this year but Covid turned out to be a boon as sales are up 41% over last year.

I would not usually be attracted by such a company but, in these trying times using the bus or the metro is not as enjoyable as going for a ride on your own with your brand new bike.

We all saw what peleton did in the last month. Logically we should see the same trend with bike company. As an alternative to gym, outdoors activities and transport, bike sales could possibly surges this summer.

Since a few days mass media has been selling us the idea of a bike shortage,

since demand exceed supply we should see a rise in the value of the bike division of dorel. Wich could finally make the company profitable. I'm not saying these are guaranteed tendies but its better than an overbought shopify or a dead-end stock like cruise or airlines.

This is a stock play, volume is to low for options, im gonna take profit at 6.00$ and 7.00$ im in since yesterday.

2176,stocks,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

2222,stocks,"Hello everyone. I have a probably rather simple question to answer, but can't seem to find the answer online...

I started using TDAmeritrade for my first time investing last week. Last Thursday I believe. I deposited 4k right away with the intent to invest in two companies that hit a low, but know they will go back up. So, I deposited right away and on Friday afternoon, or so, I bought 2k of one company just to get started. This is the first truly investing myself, so I am learning as I go. Anyways, my funds weren't cleared at the time. I guess they will clear this Thursday, for whatever reason. I then bought a few hundred of another company yesterday leaving me with around $1500 that I have not touched. My question is on margins...

&amp;#x200B;

As my money hasn't cleared, is that why I have all sorts of margin deductions and numbers? I've always heard negative things about them, and want to make sure I use my cash only. I am up a few hundred dollars on top of the 4k I deposited in, but I want to make sure that once my cash does clear, it will fix my margin stuff, because that doesn't make sense and I want to make sure its my money I'm using and not borrowed money, if that makes sense..

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry for the noob question, I am still learning.","Okay, I am confused and it makes me worried..."

2227,stocks,"Growth stocks commonly have a very high price to earnings ratio if they make a profit at all. They have a price to book ratio much larger than one. And their sales are pretty small compared to the market cap.

So overall, things would need to change drastically (let's say sales need to increase tenfold or even more!) for these companies to reach valuations comparable to more established companies.

It is actually very common that these companies operate in markets that do not even allow such growth.

So the only way to consider these stocks fair market value is if the stock itself (and the growth of the stock) is the product of the company and not its actual business. The promise to get rich. At that point it really becomes hard to distinguish these stocks from a pyramid scheme. 

Now, if these more established companies would not exist, I would understand why people are investing in growth. But if the best case scenario is what the established companies have already become, I find it hard to not lose faith in the market.

2236,stocks,"Take this as advice, a rant, a sob story, or whatever you'd like, but I want to share how I believe I was screwed several times by investing in JCP unsecured bonds (JBN).

1. Coronavirus - Yeah, everyone got burned a little, but several companies in the retail sector were forced into bankruptcy with no real help because of it, JCP one of them. Yeah, it was risky to begin with, but I did my due diligence. I *knew* that JCP wouldn't go BK until 2023 at the earliest. Who knew government would force companies to shut down by no fault of their own for 2+ months and then not bail them out? Seriously, I normally like Trump, but I think he wants retail to burn because Macy's stopped selling his ties in 2016 and he never forgot about it.
2. Execs pulling a fast one - At least everyone in the company suffered, including execs w/ equity in the company, right? Wrong. A couple days before BK, the top brass cut themselves a deal, paying millions to retain themselves with the caveat of giving up equity/performance bonuses in the company, which they knew was worthless with bankruptcy imminent. The whole point of giving the top brass payment in the form of shares is to incentivize them to do what's best for the shareholders because they're in the same boat. If they can just pay themselves out and jump ship, then it was all an illusion. Not only that, but their millions were paid out with money that would have went to bondholders. Why are they worth retaining? I had some faith in Jill, but all she really did was reverse decisions of horrible CEOs before her and downsize, cutting poor performing stores. She never got to the point of implementing anything new to help the company become profitable and grow.
3. Locking the shares - During this BK, a small sliver of light presented itself when AMZN hinted at buying JCP, something which would likely bring some value greater than what a bankruptcy agreement would. However, instead of letting people who want to take the risk take it and those who would be happy to cash out on the hype cash out, the symbol was locked, both the bond and the stock (Symbol is now JCPNQ btw).

I write this because I never expected so much interference in a system that is supposed to be a FREE MARKET. Point 2 is less of an attack on the free market and more of just blatant corruption. There are rules to stop insider trading when things are going on behind the scenes, yet this payout seems like obvious loophole to that. I had A LOT of my eggs in this basket, so I'm hurting right now and just praying for a AMZN deal that helps unsecured bondholders. I needed to vent a little, but hopefully it provides some value to someone with the lesson that no one is on your side, company executives or government, even if they pretend to be.",How my situation with JCP made me lose faith in the free market.

2243,stocks,"Im from Europe and I’ve been using Trading 212, and i mostly day trade. The platform is easy to use and have a great demo simulator.

I inserted a realistic amount in the demo account which was 500€. Everyday I managed to get a profit of 50-100€, sometimes even up to 150€. I used Germany 30 (Index) to trade with and the leverage was 1/500, I always bought 1,2 shares (one share costs 11.000€). 

Because of leverage I managed to get good profit everyday but was risky sometimes ngl, thats why I never went over 1,2 shares.

But when I opened my real account. The leverage went from 1/500 to 1/30 and I might insert 200€ instead.

I do know that my profit would be much less, because of less leverage and smaller account. But I don’t mind that, because this will make it less risky and I’m young as well and want to take thing slow.

Anyways my question is will I get same amount of % profit if i buy/short 0,03 shares of the same market/index (Germany 30)?

Here is a better explanation

Here is the math (tell me if I’m wrong)

11.000€ per share (Germany 30)

When I used demo: 
Leverage; 1/500

I bought 1,2 shares

= 11.000*1.2=13.200€
= 13.200/500=26,4€

26,4€ is how much a 1,2 share would cost me with 1/500 leverage

26,4/500*100=5,28% 

This means that I used 5.28% of my (fake) 500€ money and made me get approximately 75€ everyday.

If I use my real account:
Leverage; 1/30

Thinking on buying only 0,03 shares
= 11.000*0.03=330€
= 330/30=11€

11€ is how much a 0,03 share would cost me with 1/30 leverage

11/200*100=5,5%

This means that I will use 5,5% of my real 200€ money and will make me (75/500*100=15% profit) 15% profit of 200€=30€. So approximately 30€ profit everyday right?

Am I doing the math right? Is this approximately how much profit I will get with a 200€ account with 1/30 leverage? I might be right but I really don’t wanna mess things up before I start",Just opened my trading account after 5+ weeks of using demo account. I got some questions before I start properly.

2301,stocks,"I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

2325,stocks,"Obviously this isn't a flashy name and what they sell isn't sexy but hear me out. This company makes all the random shit you see in grocery stores, food stalls, cafeterias, movie theaters, stadiums: Super Pretzels, ICEE, Slush Puppie, churros, minute maid popsicles, funnel cakes, italian ice, bakery goods, etc. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service (#1 revenue stream), Frozen Beverages (#2) , and Retail Supermarket (#3).

Since 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. Now enter in the beer flu, that streak will snap as everything they sell into is closed except for supermarket. Q1 earnings, as expected, were trash:

- Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
- Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
- Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)


Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year.  Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year.  Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago. 

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.  

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

Hi

I recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.

Now market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.

1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.
2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam
3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.

As for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.

For IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.

All in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",Is IBD a SCAM.?(Investor Business Daily Review)

Thank you for getting in touch with us.

I was able to review the case in-depth and it does appear that the loss was caused by the market opening with a gap, thus executing the order at the price of 36.65, which is the opening market price.

I would be glad if I was able to shed some light on the situation.

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price.

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.

We all know what Disney+ has done to DIS stock. Even with the virus shutting down the parks, ESPN having nothing to show, DIS is doing pretty great thanks to its streaming service Disney+. 

DIS has essentially become a meme stock. There has been tons of hype and chat on reddit and other forums about it. 

However, I never see any HBO MAX or AT&amp;T hype. WarnerMedia has a MASSIVE array of entertainment companies and content under its belt. It’s launching soon but it hasn’t gotten as much hype on stock forums.

Based on the lack of discussion, I am thinking it’s not yet priced in. I’ve bought shares in AT&amp;T hoping to see them spike in June when HBO MAX announces number of new subscribers. 

I’m thinking with new subscribers, some “analysts” hyping it, and eventually more discussion on forums - maybe it’ll become a new meme stock like DIS.

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.

&gt;Food  giant Nestle said on Wednesday it would spend 100 million swiss francs  on expanding its manufacturing footprint in China to include a new  plant-based food facility and widen its production lines.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  company said its first plant-based food facility for Asia would be  built in Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area and that it  could launch faux meat products by the end of this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;ADVERTISEMENT.  China's ""Free from meat"" market, which includes alternative meat  products, grew 33.5% since 2014 to be worth just under $10 billion in  2018, according to Euromonitor.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  Nescafe coffee maker said the investment in TEDA would also include a  significant capacity expansion of Nestle's existing Purina pet food  plant, with new production lines offering consumers premium veterinary  diet and wet cat food products.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  company, which has 31 production sites in China, also said it would  increase annual production capacity of a local biscuit wafer plant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nestle's  proposed investment comes just a few weeks after U.S. agribusiness  giant Cargill \[CARG.UL\] said it would introduce a range of plant-based  meat products in China following a successful trial of faux meat nuggets  by KFC-owner Yum China Holdings.

2545,stocks,"After losing a war with options (lost $1,500), I swore off using options as a get rich quick scheme. It makes for cool WSB gain posts, can’t deny that. But I was terrible at it so I swore it off. 

Recently I decided it would be smart to invest 15-20k in RTX with hope that it would go back to its COVID upside of $66-$67 (I bought in at $59). 

Theoretically if I sold my shares at a price target of $68-70 I’d profit almost $2,000 which is almost an entire months income for me (college grad with shit salary). 

I’ve been thinking of repeating this process in the future with other blue chip stocks I believe in, with the purpose of simply holding it up to a month and selling it within that time frame to clinch profits of about $2,000 at a time give or take. 
￼

This would help me so much. It would essentially give me double the income that I have now, and wouldn’t require me picking up an extra job, plus I really enjoy the market. 

I know that a lot of this hinges on the market moving in my favor within 4 weeks, but realistically I think it could be pulled off most months (it’s been one and half weeks since I invested in RTX, in that time it dropped to $50 and moved back up to almost my break even price of $58)

Do you think this is a bad method for increasing my income steadily in the stock market?

Should I be splitting this 15-20k or buying power into two or three blue chip stocks to diversify? Theoretically it sounds like it would be better, but also I would have to keep tabs on three different companies which is more work and time consuming. And there’s always a chance that multiple or all of my trades end up going down and costing me time waiting for them to break even.

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",The Bearish Case for Stocks

Hi guys,

Following the [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) today, 

I did a little bit digging, and there are some quite ridiculous Chinese State-Owned Enterprises and government agencies currently trading on NYSE. 

Apparently, SEC and the regulating bodies in the US cannot check their books because it's considered as ""[State Secret](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/06/china-and-the-u-s-stock-market-nowhere-to-go.html)"" by the Chinese government??

And they got state-owned airlines, telecom, oil, even railroad built with money raised from American investors???

And these Chinese State-Owned Enterprises just come to the US market and raise money and swindle US retail investors out of money??? Something has to be done!

Not sure about NASDAQ, will look more into it this week.

If you have positions in these companies, get out and be careful of other Chinese private companies as well, the Luckin book issue may be just tip of the iceberg. [Alibaba Group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-growth-becomes-a-tougher-sell-on-wall-street-11586426382) can hide the accounting malpractices for now, but in the next 6-12 months with the pandemic and the attention on CCP being responsible? Shit is going to hit the fan for these Chinese companies, and they will run from the NASDAQ and NYSE with American investors' money.

A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.

2558,stocks,"It's not pretty out there in value investing land.  Most have gone full Growth At Any Price while the rest are panicking.

These guys are demanding that management cut expenses, buyback stock, and start investing in the future, all of which management is doing very well.  They've bought back 40% of the stock and have taken a break from that to buyback their remaining debt for 70c on the Dollar.  They've slashed headcount and compensation to the bone while restoring productivity and cleaning up both the debt and current assets &amp; liabilities.  The balance sheet will be pristine once they pay off the last of this debt.

Revenue fell by a fifth last year, and everyone's going to pieces over it.  Meanwhile, even NPD is admitting that console sales for Xbox and PlayStation have collapsed by the same rate as GME's because they delayed the launches by yet another year after a record length in the console cycle.  All of that lost revenue constituted the entirety of last year's would-be profits.  If GME's failing right now, so are the console divisions of SNE and MSFT even though they historically are 2/3 to 3/4 of total industry units and revenue.

In times like these when value stocks are the cheapest they've ever been, it's fun to see who really has what it takes to be a true value investor.  Even Toby Carlisle's sidekick Bill Brewster just threw in the towel because he thinks value no longer works while it sits at the biggest spread to glamour since the 2000 and 1929 bubbles.

Let's see if the shareholders are just as jumpy and vote for the guys who claim they'll restore the company to glory by paying both management and non-executives nothing and borrowing recklessly to buyback stock as they take credit for the potential $10 billion in sales this year, based upon catch up demand.",Someone should tell Hestia &amp; Permit the only reason why there weren't any profits at GME last year was because no one was buying Xboxes and PlayStations

Wall Street had priced in an earnings beat as TTWO has risen over 10% in the last 10 days but numbers this good weren't expected. Currently up another 2%+ in after hours trading. 

TTWO is an independent video game publisher and the company behind titles like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Sid Meier's Civilization, and NBA 2K. They are known for longer development times and quality games compared to other shops like Activision and Electronic Arts who are notorious for shipping incomplete games needing significant patching that are filled with microtransactions.

Financially, they are in great shape. No debt, solid cash flow, and a strong track record of success releasing both new titles and sequels. There was concern that they would underperform in 2020 as they have no major titles set for release this year but Covid turned out to be a boon as sales are up 41% over last year. 

I hold TTWO and will continue holding on to it. Very solid, well run company.

2676,stocks,"**Summary:** Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM) IPO-ed in February, raising $188 M to advance their preclinical gene-editing platform. The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam’s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam’s favorite analogy, think of BEAM’s platform as the “pencil and eraser” versus the “scissors” of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam’s pipeline, but with the company’s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.

***We invested in BEAM (\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company’s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***

**Key Takeaways**

* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.
* Current market cap of \~$1.1 B offers \~3x upside by \~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam’s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.
* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. 
* The company’s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.
* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.
* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.
* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\]. Applying Beam’s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam’s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. 
* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).
* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a “wave” of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam’s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren’t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. 
* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.
* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.

2694,stocks,"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

As we endure this collective battle, there are few subjects that spark populist anger more than personal protection equipment (PPE) and its lack of availability for frontline workers – not to mention the average household.

The most important of this class of object is probably the N95 mask. The importance of these masks is well summarized by the fact that healthcare information sources have gone so far as to attempt to convince Joe Public that they don’t work to protect the wearer from airborne droplets carrying SARS-CoV-2 microbial agents because we need to make sure frontline responders have access to a sufficient supply, and authorities are desperately afraid of hoarding among the general public.

The masks do work, and we don’t have enough of them.

That creates a terrible reality. But it also creates an opportunity for those nasty capitalists among us who understand that they might invest their own savings in companies offering solutions to this whole mess, thereby helping to save the world with abject greed.

I started using TDAmeritrade for my first time investing last week. Last Thursday I believe. I deposited 4k right away with the intent to invest in two companies that hit a low, but know they will go back up. So, I deposited right away and on Friday afternoon, or so, I bought 2k of one company just to get started. This is the first truly investing myself, so I am learning as I go. Anyways, my funds weren't cleared at the time. I guess they will clear this Thursday, for whatever reason. I then bought a few hundred of another company yesterday leaving me with around $1500 that I have not touched. My question is on margins...

&amp;#x200B;

As my money hasn't cleared, is that why I have all sorts of margin deductions and numbers? I've always heard negative things about them, and want to make sure I use my cash only. I am up a few hundred dollars on top of the 4k I deposited in, but I want to make sure that once my cash does clear, it will fix my margin stuff, because that doesn't make sense and I want to make sure its my money I'm using and not borrowed money, if that makes sense..

2727,stocks,"Growth stocks commonly have a very high price to earnings ratio if they make a profit at all. They have a price to book ratio much larger than one. And their sales are pretty small compared to the market cap.

So overall, things would need to change drastically (let's say sales need to increase tenfold or even more!) for these companies to reach valuations comparable to more established companies.

It is actually very common that these companies operate in markets that do not even allow such growth.

So the only way to consider these stocks fair market value is if the stock itself (and the growth of the stock) is the product of the company and not its actual business. The promise to get rich. At that point it really becomes hard to distinguish these stocks from a pyramid scheme. 

Now, if these more established companies would not exist, I would understand why people are investing in growth. But if the best case scenario is what the established companies have already become, I find it hard to not lose faith in the market.

2736,stocks,"Take this as advice, a rant, a sob story, or whatever you'd like, but I want to share how I believe I was screwed several times by investing in JCP unsecured bonds (JBN).

1. Coronavirus - Yeah, everyone got burned a little, but several companies in the retail sector were forced into bankruptcy with no real help because of it, JCP one of them. Yeah, it was risky to begin with, but I did my due diligence. I *knew* that JCP wouldn't go BK until 2023 at the earliest. Who knew government would force companies to shut down by no fault of their own for 2+ months and then not bail them out? Seriously, I normally like Trump, but I think he wants retail to burn because Macy's stopped selling his ties in 2016 and he never forgot about it.
2. Execs pulling a fast one - At least everyone in the company suffered, including execs w/ equity in the company, right? Wrong. A couple days before BK, the top brass cut themselves a deal, paying millions to retain themselves with the caveat of giving up equity/performance bonuses in the company, which they knew was worthless with bankruptcy imminent. The whole point of giving the top brass payment in the form of shares is to incentivize them to do what's best for the shareholders because they're in the same boat. If they can just pay themselves out and jump ship, then it was all an illusion. Not only that, but their millions were paid out with money that would have went to bondholders. Why are they worth retaining? I had some faith in Jill, but all she really did was reverse decisions of horrible CEOs before her and downsize, cutting poor performing stores. She never got to the point of implementing anything new to help the company become profitable and grow.
3. Locking the shares - During this BK, a small sliver of light presented itself when AMZN hinted at buying JCP, something which would likely bring some value greater than what a bankruptcy agreement would. However, instead of letting people who want to take the risk take it and those who would be happy to cash out on the hype cash out, the symbol was locked, both the bond and the stock (Symbol is now JCPNQ btw).

I write this because I never expected so much interference in a system that is supposed to be a FREE MARKET. Point 2 is less of an attack on the free market and more of just blatant corruption. There are rules to stop insider trading when things are going on behind the scenes, yet this payout seems like obvious loophole to that. I had A LOT of my eggs in this basket, so I'm hurting right now and just praying for a AMZN deal that helps unsecured bondholders. I needed to vent a little, but hopefully it provides some value to someone with the lesson that no one is on your side, company executives or government, even if they pretend to be.",How my situation with JCP made me lose faith in the free market.

2743,stocks,"Im from Europe and I’ve been using Trading 212, and i mostly day trade. The platform is easy to use and have a great demo simulator.

I inserted a realistic amount in the demo account which was 500€. Everyday I managed to get a profit of 50-100€, sometimes even up to 150€. I used Germany 30 (Index) to trade with and the leverage was 1/500, I always bought 1,2 shares (one share costs 11.000€). 

Because of leverage I managed to get good profit everyday but was risky sometimes ngl, thats why I never went over 1,2 shares.

But when I opened my real account. The leverage went from 1/500 to 1/30 and I might insert 200€ instead.

I do know that my profit would be much less, because of less leverage and smaller account. But I don’t mind that, because this will make it less risky and I’m young as well and want to take thing slow.

Anyways my question is will I get same amount of % profit if i buy/short 0,03 shares of the same market/index (Germany 30)?

Here is a better explanation

Here is the math (tell me if I’m wrong)

11.000€ per share (Germany 30)

When I used demo: 
Leverage; 1/500

I bought 1,2 shares

= 11.000*1.2=13.200€
= 13.200/500=26,4€

26,4€ is how much a 1,2 share would cost me with 1/500 leverage

26,4/500*100=5,28% 

This means that I used 5.28% of my (fake) 500€ money and made me get approximately 75€ everyday.

If I use my real account:
Leverage; 1/30

Thinking on buying only 0,03 shares
= 11.000*0.03=330€
= 330/30=11€

11€ is how much a 0,03 share would cost me with 1/30 leverage

11/200*100=5,5%

2801,stocks,"I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

- Sales to food service customers decreased $3,735,000 or 2% in the second quarter to $171,332,000
- Frozen beverage and related product sales decreased 6% to $63,139,000
- Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $3,404,000 or 10% to $37,571,000 (again because everything else closed)


Net earnings decreased 64% to $7.3 million in the current quarter from $20.4 million last year.  Earnings per diluted share decreased 65% to $.38 for the second quarter from $1.08 last year.  Operating income decreased 56% to $11.0 million in the current quarter from $24.8 million in the year ago quarter. They even mention sales for the first 4 weeks of its third quarter that will end June 27, 2020 were down approximately 45% from a year ago. 

That said, J&amp;J has $267 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it does not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor does it anticipate a material amount of its assets would be impaired.  

$JJSF closed today at $123.04, down over 30% YTD and 37% from its $196.84 52wk high. They are going to get hammered again with probably even uglier earnings on 7/27, but feel this is a strong long term play on the later half of this year once reopening advances and can get a better idea on when all the food stalls, stadiums, cafeterias, movie theaters, concerts, fairs can operate in full capacity and (most importantly) people will want to fill them mixed with the new customer growth from supermarket sales. Say it takes 3 years to get back to 2019 levels, a ~10% annual return ain't bad.

An important follow up, what are your thoughts on the timing of the delisting notice and the fact that luckin shares will no longer be halted and be available for trade tomorrow?

Though sales of $310million were fabricated, Luckin arguably has more value than the stock price currently reflects (contingent on their ability to recover from this PR nightmare).

These questions lie ahead: Will Luckin survive? Will it get dumped to squeeze out retail investors before big money / Chinese investment companies hop in? And what implications follow the delisting notice? Do you see it having any chance of remaining listed or do you think it’ll be gone?

Hi everyone:

I'm trying to find a website that reports on **big news stories in real-time** and **what is driving the markets in real-time.**

Case  in point: today at \~2:50PM EST, news broke that the Moderna vaccine  results have some problems with it. Stocks plunged between 2:55 PM and  3:00 PM.

News sites reported on this vaccine news with 30-60 min lag, which is far too long if you're trying to daytrade aggressively.

* CNBC reported on the [vaccine news](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/19/experts-say-moderna-didnt-produce-data-critical-to-assessing-vaccine.html) at 3:26 PM.
* Bloomberg [reported on this ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/asia-stocks-to-advance-after-u-s-rally-oil-gains-markets-wrap?srnd=premium)at 3:39 PM.
* SeekingAlpha reported on this at 3:45 PM.
* Yahoo Finance: [4:07 PM](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/coronavirus-latest-tuesday-may-19-193838933.html)
* MarketWatch [didn't report on this](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/european-stocks-and-u-s-futures-edge-lower-after-wild-rally-51589879594?mod=newsviewer_click) until 4:12 PM
* Reuters: [4:38 PM](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/sp-stumbles-as-moderna-sinks-on-report-questioning-trial-results-idUSKBN22V1EH)

The one website I've found so far that does a good job at this is ForexLive, who [reported on this](https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/there-are-some-doubts-about-modernas-vaccine-20200519) at 3:00 PM.

Hi

I recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.

Now market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.

1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.
2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam
3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.

As for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.

For IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.

All in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",Is IBD a SCAM.?(Investor Business Daily Review)

I've read and learned quite a bit in terms of suggested allocations within an equity portfolio. However, and perhaps because this is so obvious, I can't seem to find anything confirming how the percentage should be calculated. Is it based on

1. the number of shares you own, regardless of the value of each stock, relative to the total number of shares in your portfolio, or 
2. the value of shares you have in one company/ETF, regardless of the number of shares you hold in that company/ETF, relative to the total value of your portfolio?

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

Much of the excitement has centered on Moderna Therapeutics, which had an early prospect [ready for clinical trials just 42 days](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273) after the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus was released. But while public officials and news reports were quick to cite this as a record-breaking development, the biotechnology underlying this drug [has existed for nearly 30 years](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7020037), and it has never yielded a working vaccine for any human disease. (Requests for comment from Moderna Therapeutics have not been answered.)

If the past is any indicator, the world won’t have a coronavirus vaccine for more than a year, probably longer. The mumps vaccine—considered the fastest ever approved—took four years to go from [collecting viral samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/health/maurice-hilleman-mmr-vaccines-forgotten-hero.html) to [licensing a drug in 1967](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines). Clinical trials come with three phases, and the first stages of the current COVID-19 trials [aren’t due for completion until this fall, spring 2021, or much later](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search). And there are good reasons to allow time for safety checks. Some preliminary vaccines for the related coronavirus SARS, for instance, [actually enhanced the disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9) in model experiments.
